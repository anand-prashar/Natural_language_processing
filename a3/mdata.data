Has checked the outlaw's way ; 	b
Ah ! my dear father, tell me why ? 	b
But what shall brave the deep, deep waves 	b
And gives the waves a brighter blue, 	b
Stooped, and raised his languid head ; 	b
Subdue this quenchless will ! ' 	b
He felt for all the beauty there. 	b
Turn back, from that tempestuous surge, 	b
Before it fades away ! 	b
When winter winds were wild . 	b
Warm and bright on Arden's lake 	b
All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given, 	b
Who motionless is laid . . . 	b
Of southern waters breaking to the wind, 	b
And laughter sink into a sigh, 	b
Their sunlit isles of paradise, 	b
The vain man smile, the fool deride, 	b
4 This is my home where whirlwinds blow, 	b
1 'd call forth the glorious chorus again 	b
With blood on his hand that he wept to have shed ? 	b
The space between is all forgot, 	b
* But, I '11 not fear, I will not weep 	b
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night ; 	b
I have one rite a gentle kiss ; 	b
When those who were thy own compeers, 	b
All Nature's million mysteries, 	b
To reach, at last, the eternal home, 	b
Was flitting o'er me evermore. 	b
But something whispers to my mind, 	b
What though the stars and fair moonlight 	b
And who with unregretful eyes 	b
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell 	b
Opening its ports for me and mine ; 	b
Implored to change for senseless rest 	b
How still, how happy ! These are words 	b
And what is thine that it should prove 	b
And fresh winds shook the door ; 	b
That I shall greet them ne'er again ! ' 	b
Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain ; 	b
And conquered good and conquering ill 	b
Gladly to see his gory sun 	b
Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave- 	b
Is human love so true ? 	b
The strength of eyesight to restore 	b
My monarch died to rule for ever 	b
Unawed, the darkness of the grave ? 	b
Which wilder visions muster'd to my mind ; 	b
Clothe in blood its sovereign's prayer. 	b
Hark ! listen to the distant gun 	b
Yet vainly flowed the calmer wave 	b
None need point the princely victim, 	b
* And now, 'mid northern mountains lone 	b
Are warring night and day ; 	b
From those brown hills, have melted into spring : 	b
On the shady side reclined 	b
On antique roof and hoary tree, 	b
That flush of roseate light, 	b
None but me beheld him dying, 	b
No ; 'twas not the flowery plain : 	b
Has Almadore in battle bled ! 	b
The yells, the groans, the frenzied gladness, 	b
Their careless young eyes are closed in sleeping ; 	b
T' escape from labour's tyrant power 	b
November's gusts unheeded call ; 	b
Doth he not rather roam ? 	b
And glowed both roof and floor ; 	b
And not one of all my lays 	b
1 Ice has barred the Arctic waters, 	b
The future fills me with dismay ; 	b
Felt, but unseen, the damp dewdrops fall. 	b
From those eternal waves that surge below. 	b
Rattled against an old vault's rail. 	b
When that grim concave frowned above, 	b
A thoughtful spirit taught me soon, 	b
There if he can to die alone ? ' 	b
When it has worn through many a week 	b
Because thy soul is clear ; 	b
For ever triumphing : 	b
Too truly agonised to weep, 	b
Through wind and ocean's roar, 	b
The face, all deadly fair, 	b
Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire, 	b
AH ! why, because the dazzling sun 	b
But voiceless silence everywhere. 	b
December's sullen time ! 	b
Hope soothes me in the griefs I know ; 	b
Can rob us of the past. 	b
That now I cannot feel ! 	b
That Death he took a certain aim, 	b
The grave is drear, but they are not there : 	b
Away, away, resign thee now 	b
How every drift in their glens profound 	b
Or bless not me with heaven ! * 	b
There is no need of other sound 	b
Of youth's delight, when youth is past, 	b
Day by day some dreary token 	b
But hope is dead for him. 	b
She scarcely feels the flow ; 	b
Faltering, faint, and ready to die. 	b
Begins another voyage nay, they 're gone ; 	b
1 see them foaming high ; 	b
Before their hearts went wandering wrong, 	b
From tracking farther day by day, 	b
Day breathes such beauty over earth and sky, 	b
Raised on my pillow, to descry 	b
And, in the red fire's cheerful glow, 	b
And Lord Eldred glancing round, 	b
And thou false friend and treacherous guide 	b
And never radiant bow could be 	b
Drinks tears, instead of dew ; 	b
A winter sunset in the west 	b
A faithless heart to thee ? 	b
And let Thy holy Spirit shine 	b
Darken that triumphant eye ! 	b
Blood-red, he rose, and, arrow-straight, 	b
Where tears and mourning cannot come. 	b
That wander down to drink the tide. 	b
Enough if storms have bowed his head, 	b
Even Memory's voice grew dim ; 	b
For round their hearths they'll tell this 	b
Yet, loved one, it must be : 	b
More drear I cannot be ! 	b
Those sad relics scattered round ; 	b
The giant sons of Anakim 	b
Sweet, how softly sweet it came 	b
And all around his youthful brow 	b
With alien breezes sadly blent. 	b
All her cherished hopes should wane, 	b
SWART steed of night, thou hast charged thy last 	b
Its face is fair divinely fair ; 	b
It will not, cannot rise ; 	b
But if that night bring only sleep, 	b
Deep in unknown eternity ; 	b
How could I seek the empty world again ? 	b
My eyes are full of tears, 	b
No later light has lightened up my heaven, 	b
Where evening closes dark and chill ; 	b
The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the 	b
Concludes thy musing once again ? 	b
' O DAY ! he cannot die 	b
To breathe its bliss on me ; 	b
Through this false world, their all had 	b
The stream in silence sang once more 	b
And woke her with a sudden song ; 	b
Roderic, for thee shall never rise ! 	b
With my consoling tear? 	b
To the enduring seas 	b
THE ABSENT ONE 	b
O then another daybreak 	b
And grew in another bed ; 	b
1 Oh, for the time when I shall sleep 	b
DREAM, where art thou now ? 	b
Such tears as I weep it is not so ! 	b
And voiceless, soulless, messenger, 	b
O gallant horse, hold on thy course ; 	b
But still they gave no certain token 	b
The captive raised her face ; it was as soft and 	b
To the deadliest press of the gathering fight 	b
Though not because my heart is tame, 	b
' And why should we be glad at all ? 	b
Oh, for the day, when I shall rest, 	b
Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine ; 	b
1 And thou art gone with all thy pride ; 	b
They were clothed in savage attire ; 	b
For the woe I could not bear 	b
Than other love, more true? 	b
Must always fade, and always cloy : 	b
One long look, that sore reproved me 	b
I am thinking of my latest shock, 	b
For now might Faith decay. 	b
Sit beneath the ancient thorn. 	b
And morning's beams will rise as drear. 	b
Their happy souls are gone to God I 	b
Buried in a hapless tomb. 	b
Clouded, even as they would weep. 	b
And, while the wide earth echoing rung 	b
I ne'er had raised this coward cry 	b
To leave our children slaves ! 	b
She heard the river's restless wave 	b
The vast crowds vanished every one ; 	b
And 'mid flowery, smiling plains ; 	b
That we may overflow the sky 	b
I shall smile when wreaths of snow 	b
Till the tufted leaves of the garden bower 	b
But not of wail for men ! 	b
Ah ! no : with louder sound 	b
Gone by as if they 'd never been ; 	b
No ; turn towards the western side. 	b
Or unreal phantoms of distress ! 	b
Her spirit is the unfathomed lake 	b
Adoring virtue's distant star. 	b
ON a sunny brae alone I lay 	b
Wrought up in rain and wailing wind : 	b
Youthful he seemed but worn as they 	b
THE evening sun was sinking down 	b
Exhausted with repinings vain, 	b
The grass-grown grave, did lie, 	b
Daughter divine ! and could his gaze 	b
Where will these bright things be ? 	b
The grand remains of ancient state. 	b
And, all for listening, never sleep. 	b
In all His works displayed. 	b
To greet the general glow. 	b
With a wild and passing thrill, 	b
Are shadowed by her hand at last 	b
grant thy prayer ? 	b
To wander through the snow. 	b
Nor ever let my spirit tire, 	b
And while on that reflected face 	b
And cold suspicion never rise ; 	b
Where thou, and I, and Liberty, 	b
Burned within the avenging flame : 	b
It is but thought full many a night 	b
For them a thousand hopes remain, 	b
The evening comes before the noon, 	b
With heart as summer sunshine light 	b
A wanderer o'er the Atlantic main ; 	b
Till sorrow's source were dry, 	b
Could that sacrifice have purchased 	b
Its green boughs in the breezy sky. 	b
And cheek almost as white as death, 	b
Was it with the fields of green, 	b
Have long forgot their vow ; 	b
The flowers of Fancy, newly-blown : 	b
The starry halls of Elrington 	b
This glorious vision of a grove, 	b
New glories o'er the blighted spring, 	b
Wild the road, and rough and dreary ; 	b
And yet there is or seems at least to be 	b
1 Our guests are darkly lodged,' I whisper'd, gazing 	b
And only wake with you ! 	b
Bowed lowest at thy shrine, 	b
The little glittering spirits sung, 	b
And every vision of old Afric's shore 	b
And my remorse shall die. 	b
And sweeter hope, when hope despairs ! 	b
When the wearied host of the conqueror lies 	b
And the purple violet sweet ; 	b
This day on Elmor Hill ! ! ! ' 	b
While heaven and earth are whispering me, 	b
His own creation's dread despair ! 	b
King Julius lifts his impious eye 	b
Round her returning sight appear 	b
In English fields my limbs were laid, 	b
I dreamt one dark and stormy night 	b
The spirit sent his dazzling gaze 	b
It gathers up thoughts akin to madness, 	b
My heart's blood flows to buy the blessing to 	b
I was at peace, and drank your beams 	b
Might fill with sympathy. 	b
To twilight's shade forlorn ? 	b
What made her weep, what made her glide 	b
A wider sound than mountain wind 	b
Yet still steeped in memory's dyes 	b
Above me, in that stormless sea, 	b
I long to hope that all the woe 	b
In summer's pride imbue 	b
Then I shall rest, while thou wilt weep. 	b
Yet ever in my grateful breast 	b
Where thick the leaves are dancing, 	b
It was thus I said as her graceful head 	b
My mortal flesh you might debar, 	b
They gain the rock's steep wall. 	b
Ye earthly cares begone ! 	b
Or Virtue crouched to Infamy ; 	b
For I Ve been consecrate to grief 	b
Some were dazzling like the sun ; 	b
That struggles in thy breast 	b
A murmuring round the wall. 	b
My downy couch with silk was hung. 	b
And helpless Reason warn in vain ; 	b
Glides through the maze of pleasure wild. 	b
And Peace, the lethargy of Grief ; 	b
And Hope, a phantom of the soul ; 	b
He ever held in his arms. 	b
LADYBIRD ! ladybird ! fly away home, 	b
And trembling yet to hear his name, 	b
While nightly stars are burning, 	b
While evening pours its silent dew, 	b
And will not heaven itself bestow 	b
I trust not to thy phantom bliss, 	b
'My master's voice is low, his aspect bland and 	b
Yet the faint wind comes soothingly 	b
Round walls where only you are vigil keeping? 	b
To-morrow both shall soar away, 	b
Winds sigh as you are sighing, 	b
Entreating, till his eyes o'erflowed, 	b
Gaze on the wretch recall to mind 	b
My spirit should startle their rest and tell, 	b
Since misery was such misery. 	b
To dungeons where a prisoner lies? 	b
PLEAD FOR ME 	b
STILL beside that dreary water 	b
And now the twilight calm and sweet 	b
They stood by mute and pale ; 	b
Restored into the Deity.' 	b
And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
A prayer that would come forth altho' it lingered 	b
And twenty years of tyrant pride 	b
O'er all the crossing thoughts that overflowed. 	b
No, radiant angel, speak and say 	b
And it sprung and flourished ; 	b
Thou bear'st the dim tie of ceaseless dreams, 	b
The earth shone round with a long-lost charm : 	b
For Thine own sake, be Thou its guide, 	b
It had gathered beauty from sunshine and shower, 	b
BETWEEN distress and pleasure 	b
Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays, 	b
The moor-lark in the air, 	b
And saw my offerings on their shrine ; 	b
I thought that Gabriel's self had come 	b
Weighed beneath a mortal sleep ; 	b
So, with a ready heart, I swore 	b
To seek their altar-stone no more ; 	b
His soul has felt the storm below, 	b
Behold him 1 	b
And set my spirit free ? 	b
He must have once been beautiful, 	b
Because we dare not stay to gain 	b
Like vultures round their prey. 	b
A weak and helpless prey ! 	b
How loud the storm sounds round the hall ! 	b
My darling pain that wounds and sears, 	b
Rude the couch that rests us weary ; 	b
Rested from the battle's roar ; 	b
As she would seek repose ; 	b
Mine eye to meet her eye ; 	b
And am I wrong to worship where 	b
wind that blows ; 	b
Of heavy rain or tempest near. 	b
Would part and sunlight shone between, 	b
And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
* THE evening passes fast away, 	b
Lips, that did breathe no murmuring 	b
The wild birds raise their brood ; 	b
What feelings in thy breast?' 	b
One moment, ere I go 	b
Of labour hardly done ; 	b
A thousand thousand silvery lyres 	b
But this world's life has much to dread, 	b
What shadow is it 	b
Bliss like thine is bought by years 	b
'Tis sweet to wander here at night, 	b
I 'M happiest now when most away 	b
One gleam of her heaven-bright face to see. 	b
And Time should Fate condemn ; 	b
Which coming death denied ; 	b
* Then art thou glad to seek repose ? 	b
The bee among the heather bells 	b
AND first an hour of mournful musing, 	b
And earth looks back so dazzling bright 	b
As the dear friend untimely called away ; 	b
And call a lovelier Life from Death, 	b
I breathed not but to send above 	b
That comforts me while thou art here, 	b
Palace and temple crown the glade. 	b
As one who mourns the dead. 	b
Why did the morning dawn to break 	b
And would not pass away ! 	b
Lament their absence drear ; 	b
Over my western beauty's grave, 	b
Patriot fathers' bloody tombs ; 	b
Would rather fight than rest. ' 	b
No ; that tree with branches riven 	b
And sleet and frozen gloom ? 	b
With my dear comrades young and gay, 	b
This very crowd is vacancy ; 	b
I chide with my soul I bid it cherish 	b
From bleak December's sky ? 	b
They deluge my heart like the rain 	b
Within its mossy cell. 	b
How gloomy grows the night ! Tis Gondal's 	b
But God is not like human kind, 	b
Shall meet our dearest, when we die ; 	b
Buried in moors and mountains wild, 	b
Defeat serenely borne, 	b
Which but because more broken gleams 	b
And visions rise, and change, that kill me with 	b
The tiny fountain, churning spray 	b
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall. 	b
Even where he yearns to be I 	b
From the fresh root of Eternity ! 	b
And I may sing and muse aloud, 	b
Their timid forms to guard from harm ; 	b
I love thee, boy, for all divine, 	b
From the dark marble to the sky, 	b
Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom ; 	b
And hush that music's solemn sound, 	b
But, within its parent's kindly bosom, 	b
My love, altho' the very dead 	b
Without the veil between. 	b
Can friendship's flower droop for years 	b
Will forsake thy memory, 	b
All mist and tempest free? 	b
And, behold ! with tenfold increase blessing, 	b
Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray ; 	b
The moonbeams softly shine. 	b
For many a week and many a day 	b
The waveless ocean of repose. 	b
Than Native's heaven can pour. 	b
Down through that ocean's gloomy night ; 	b
Cruel Death ! The young leaves droop and 	b
When flowers were closed and day was o'er 	b
No ! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish 	b
The thrilling shouts of fighting men, 	b
She was cruel in her fear ; 	b
Was only sullen there ! 	b
If our vessels sailed adverse on life's stormy main. 	b
AT CASTLE WOOD 	b
But as in fit of peevish woe, 	b
'Cumber the spirit that would soar 	b
The outward tumult seemed to assuage 	b
Out to the park this dreary day, 	b
She turns from heaven a tearless eye 	b
Even weeping o'er that wretch's woe ; 	b
And mingled with a foreign mould. 	b
One sign of sympathising woe, 	b
A snowy brow in ringlets small, 	b
Till at last, all old links broken, 	b
Vain as thou wert, and weak as vain, 	b
Make answer far and near. 	b
And this is just the joyous hour 	b
Thy soul is powerless over mine.' 	b
She would not, in her tranquil sleep, 	b
She thought when that confession crossed 	b
Do I despise the timid deer, 	b
Chain and bar and dungeon wall 	b
And heaven itself, so pure and blest, 	b
And still entreated him to stay. 	b
And he was once an ardent boy ; 	b
I saw His wisdom and His power 	b
And nothing in the twilight sky 	b
How can I rouse my sinking soul 	b
Say, ' Earth, lie lightly on that breast, 	b
Tortured Gondal's liberty ! 	b
The wind blew from the sea. 	b
But the joy of life was flown 	b
And every window glistens bright 	b
With leaves of frozen dew. 	b
O look again, for still on high 	b
And lights your room like day ; 	b
Bright be thine eyes, undimmed their dazzling 	b
We thought, t When winter comes again. 	b
Ere I would call its glories mine ; 	b
Its root has felt a worm, 	b
Why dost thou repeat again 	b
Till those dark orbs o'erflowing fast 	b
4 Listen ! I Ve known a burning heart, 	b
' Edward, awake, awake 	b
And every time its measured call 	b
A thousand forms, a fearful gloom ; 	b
Or gleams the sun amongst the mists of care? 	b
' When tempests roar on the lonely shore 	b
The aimless, heedless carelessness 	b
His red heart's blood drenched my dagger ; 	b
The music of the Sabbath bell. 	b
The sunshine of a summer's sun 	b
My cold heart, underneath my hand, 	b
Or wakes the breeze in the swaying trees 	b
THE day is done, the winter sun 	b
The heart is dead in infancy, 	b
To hide the streaming tear. 	b
Nor marked how from his own young 	b
To-morrow, Scorn will blight my name, 	b
Thus poured she in that cavern wild 	b
Will load me with a coward's shame 	b
'Twas thus I thought, an hour ago, 	b
And at each belt a weapon dire, 	b
Too heavenly now, but doomed to be, 	b
I cannot find a haven. 	b
When thy heart bounds ardently, 	b
His followers went out with Jubilee, 	b
Their dust is mingled with the sod, 	b
Should cause such bitter woe? 	b
Sad thoughts rose in my mind. 	b
For, who forgives the accursed crime 	b
The violet's eye might shyly flash, 	b
OH, thy bright eyes must answer now, 	b
Thy presence waked a thrilling tone 	b
Where can the weary lay his head, 	b
There have been times when this was drear, 	b
But, traitor, traitor, from that word 	b
All true breasts shrink away ! 	b
The spirit above my couch was bending. 	b
A slave, because I rule thee still ; 	b
As I can hear the ocean's fall 	b
My honour's name to spare ! 	b
And earth seemed such an alien home 	b
* What seek you now on this bleak moor brow, 	b
A sound of music reached my ear : 	b
And there you pass, in happy dreams, 	b
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 	b
Into hopeless, endless mourning. 	b
All those disturbed waves decrease 	b
Stern duty stores for me. 	b
Every leaf speaks bliss to me, 	b
That thou didst visit me? 	b
Though it roar in thunder wild, 	b
Tears have left ghastly traces there, 	b
I AM the only being whose doom 	b
And doubly will the dark world grieve me, 	b
Fast asleep and almost dying, 	b
Are brushing off the scented dew, 	b
Must always end in gloom ; 	b
Midnight moonlight's holy shrine. 	b
It closes with a tomb ! 	b
From thought of grief are free. 	b
Danger, and guilt, and darkness lie, 	b
Weary to watch the spirit languish 	b
Through years of dead despair. 	b
So, if a tear, when thou art dying, 	b
Since I beheld another dwelling. 	b
When I am not, and none beside, 	b
For wild those gusts, and well their chimes 	b
That cold departure pictures mine. 	b
My deadliest pains might die ; 	b
False she was, and unrelenting ; 	b
Seems it not that eve's declining 	b
Of dastard treachery ? 	b
Though comet-like its course was run ; 	b
As wise, to mourn the seed which grew 	b
Upon her dying mind, 	b
Its gentle ray cannot control 	b
It comes at last to cancel time, 	b
Which since this morn laid many low ; 	b
Around me, wretches uttering praise, 	b
Or howling o'er their hopeless days, 	b
It breathed from its heart invisible. 	b
A brotherhood of misery, 	b
That it quenches e'en now the vital spark, 	b
Whose madness daily maddened me, 	b
Arouse thee from thy dreams I 	b
Escape earth's dungeon tomb ? 	b
But only give me back my tears, 	b
What seems the vilest, even like thine 	b
As if to invite the smiling skies ; 	b
Of seraph's song, and demon's moan ; 	b
In concord with her reddening cheek. 	b
As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering un- 	b
And far away in woody dell 	b
I stole away from crowds and light 	b
There like a wild beast turns he back, 	b
Lavished glory on that second May ! 	b
The mortal strife that then befell ; 	b
And yet a little longer speak, 	b
4 Yet moved she not ; she only raised 	b
An earnest grief a strong desire 	b
The city's murmur softly blends 	b
That we must long till life be done ; 	b
As thick as morning's tears ; 	b
That heaven which my sweet lover's brow 	b
His frequent sighs, long-drawn and deep, 	b
And Love I laugh to scorn ; 	b
Could I have seen my country smile ? 	b
A hundred fights for them ! 	b
Little moss-rose, cease to weep, 	b
Their cruel strife may close ; 	b
Will tread its labyrinths alone. 	b
Oh, thy sweet tongue must plead for me 	b
Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 	b
'Tis all that I implore ; 	b
In life and death a chainless soul, 	b
And oh ! above the best of those 	b
If ranks beneath the cannon fall, 	b
I repent not that which my hand has done 	b
And I can sing and I can smile, 	b
Alike, while I have holiday. 	b
Where wilt thou go, my harassed heart 	b
To aid a spirit lost in crime, 	b
What spot, or near or far apart, 	b
Lights me till my life is done ; 	b
There is a spot, 'mid barren hills, 	b
And high its arched windows rise, 	b
The last full cup of triumph drink, 	b
Nor yet the ocean's wave. 	b
Bring good in rising, leave peace in decline, 	b
Sighed at first, but sighed not long ; 	b
Grows as green in April rain, 	b
One glance revealed how little care 	b
The mute bird sitting on the stone, 	b
I was not tired, my darling one, 	b
I saw to-day my enemy. 	b
For ever present to my eye, 	b
My worn heart throbs so wildly 	b
The alien firelight died away ; 	b
And seen in mist and moonlit stone, 	b
I am speaking of a later stroke, 	b
But mine sank sad and low ! 	b
And all do homage to their will, 	b
A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain 	b
And when I laughed they all replied ; 	b
'Till the dread burst breaks forth once more 	b
So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air ; 	b
And as blithely as of yore 	b
When the pen that motto drew. 	b
But long lies the dew on its crimson leaves, 	b
Up rose he, and stretched forth his hand, 	b
And revelled in my changeful dreams, 	b
Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep. 	b
Of each dark night and dim, beclouded day. 	b
I gazed within thine earnest eyes 	b
Brought to earth the fluttering game : 	b
Restraint and heavy task recoil. 	b
The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more 	b
Who spend too soon their youthful day. 	b
The common paths that others run ; 	b
That centre all the joys of years. 	b
That waves in summer air : 	b
Wears not a cloud that speaks of gloom. 	b
To soothe my spirit's care. 	b
From morning's faintest dawning 	b
Begilt with tasselled cords of gold, 	b
Wilt thou prove faithless now ? 	b
I 'd fling the brand in the hissing sea, 	b
So often to the unopened door? 	b
Have sought one gleam of mercy there ! 	b
Across the mountain stream. 	b
A few years of captivity, 	b
And ice upon the glancing stream 	b
You 've tracked me to a lonely spot. 	b
Earth's wilderness was round me spread, 	b
And night obscure his way ; 	b
Mysterious it rose from the billowy moor. 	b
Because they have no stay but thine. 	b
With thunder volleys rolling on before 	b
The sting of anguish drear/ 	b
Re-echo back again. 	b
'Tis better far away ; 	b
They who have been our life, our soul, 	b
Geraldine, wilt thou delay? 	b
For, oh ! when chill the sunbeams fall 	b
My soul, another love. 	b
Following the bend of Aspin's side, 	b
But, if there be a God above, 	b
The whole devoured and lost in death ! 	b
Ere evening far away. 	b
I could think in the withered grass 	b
The loving spirit lingers long, 	b
I turned me from that young saint's bed 	b
Through th' autumnal sky ; 	b
I watch this cloudy evening fall, 	b
For whom his spirit unforgiven 	b
Sweet voices in the halls resound, 	b
Did my exiled spirit grieve. 	b
O no, it was not this ! 	b
'Tis the last line of the woeful song ; 	b
My tortured limbs in dungeons bind, 	b
' It was spring, and the skylark was singing * ; 	b
With a solemn, plaintive sound. 	b
And waken unavailing tears. 	b
Nor absence, nor distance can quell. 	b
And lonely I am pining, 	b
They uttered the music of May ; 	b
Far less when evening's pensive hour 	b
To that deep and swelling river 	b
While thy heart suffers there. 	b
And there were garments spread, 	b
No ten can deal such deadly misery 	b
To walk by the hill-torrent's side ! 	b
It is swelled with the first snowy weather ; 	b
The rocks they are icy and hoar, 	b
Arthur, brother, we returned 	b
Fierce grew Rosina's gloomy gaze ; 	b
There are no yellow stars on the mountain ; 	b
'Tis here 'tis there, 'tis nowhere oh ! my soul, 	b
Gaze not so earnestly upon 	b
Leagues on leagues are left behind 	b
But lovelier than corn-fields all waving 	b
All thy cold and scornful pride, 	b
My spirit drank a mingled tone, 	b
I would have dreary weather, 	b
'Tis thus that human minds will turn, 	b
And envied such despair. 	b
I paused, confounded and distracted, 	b
A lip of cruel scorn ; 	b
To where those signal lights are burning, 	b
And swift were the wings to our feet given, 	b
Their brows are unshadowed, undimmed by woe. 	b
What sudden power the fancy hath 	b
That vision of a mighty host 	b
And this shall be my dream to-night ; 	b
I shall be a dream to thee. 	b
For the moors, where the linnet was trilling 	b
My present entity ! 	b
Within itself may tell ! 	b
And fair it budded day by day 	b
His features in the wave. 	b
Yawned in the city's reeling wall, 	b
On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling, 	b
In my Redeemer's name 	b
And proud its mighty columns show 	b
It feels no sympathy 	b
I hurried down the dark oak stair ; 	b
When I was hardly six years old, 	b
But not the loved music, whose waking 	b
No fear of grief in her bright eyes should quiver ; 	b
In frozen mist arrayed. 	b
Sweet land of light ! Thy children fair 	b
A mutual immortality. 	b
And sprang up to a glorious birth 	b
Needst thou then dissemble sorrow, 	b
Those tears had been heaven to me. 	b
Well well ; the sad minutes are moving, 	b
Though loaded with trouble and pain ; 	b
And some time the loved and the loving 	b
Shall meet on the mountains again I 	b
How could I ask for pitying love, 	b
Thus to the man of sin he spoke : 	b
ward votary, and to recall within his influence the proud mind 	b
And murmur, summer-streams 	b
Some nameless thing which hid not grace, 	b
She strikes it off with little care ; 	b
Shall nature cease to bow ? 	b
From such a lethargy ? 	b
Whose streets stretch round so ceaselessly. 	b
O do not think that God can leave, 	b
Subdued both grief and passion wild. 	b
Loud was the sudden gust of woe 	b
A burdened heart I bear, 	b
' Because, I hoped while they enjoyed, 	b
This shadow should night's welcome be ; 	b
When wounded he wins to the darkest wood, 	b
Sinks from the summer sky, 	b
To watch through all eternity, 	b
And then a captive's tomb. 	b
My ear drank his dying sigh. 	b
But check those coward sobs, and bring 	b
And keep it still divine 	b
Though burning thoughts that spurn control, 	b
That thy dear blood was poured in vain.' 	b
Then art thou not my golden June, 	b
Yet few would ask a heaven 	b
More like this earth than thine. 	b
Then let my winds caress thee ; 	b
But what will winter bring? 	b
Must first be utterly forgot. 	b
And earthly change from pain to pain, 	b
HERE again is the same mind in converse with a like 	b
Rank, beauty, wealth, and power combine 	b
Halos ! O far too bright to shine 	b
The opening sea seemed smooth at last ; 	b
A cloudless moon shone through 	b
* Nay, rather, Gondal's shaken throne 	b
* Douglas, he pleaded bitterly, 	b
I need not sink beneath my woes ; 	b
And yet, through every magic change, 	b
The young and aged tree, 	b
Her forehead, drooped like lily pale. 	b
I needed not its breathing 	b
Her children are rank and her kingdom's spread far. 	b
For him no tear his stern eye shed 	b
How dark the woods will be ! 	b
4 The thick leaves in my murmur 	b
It breaks upon the awful roar 	b
The time of grace is past, 	b
' Well, since it must be told, Lady, 	b
Thy perished faith shall spring to life, 	b
The ringlets of his long black hair 	b
Over the Eden of his soul ; 	b
Love, and its own life, had power to keep it 	b
All round the hot and glaring sky 	b
That dearest boon was given ; 	b
In their own course to flow.' 	b
Evince my gratitude ! 	b
Oh no ; these brighter visions vast 	b
IN MEMORY OF 	b
' 1 '11 win thee 'gainst thy will. 	b
Ere his quivering limbs, all foam-flecked, 	b
They say, ' Zalona celebrates 	b
For Nature's sad reality, 	b
And on its green bank, bathed in gore, 	b
Have slaves subdued the free? 	b
Beneath the church-aisle stone, 	b
And Truth may rudely trample down 	b
And thou for being alone.' 	b
lut dreary, strange, and pale and cold. 	b
It tumbled in an inky sea. 	b
which it is stayed. 	b
' AYE there it is ! it wakes to-night 	b
Deep feelings I thought dead ; 	b
That lulling monotone did sing 	b
To cover deeds untrue, 	b
My lonely years had known. 	b
And by thine eyes' full gaze, 	b
And by the words thou scarce dost speak, 	b
The anguish in my breast, 	b
Besides the mist is half withdrawn, 	b
The moon of summer pours 	b
I weary for that land divine, 	b
O'er each familiar tower. 	b
1 It is hope's spell that glorifies, 	b
That welled from mortal grief, I knew 	b
I HAVE gone backward in the work, 	b
The whisper of its fall : 	b
But those were in the early glow 	b
From thine own influence free ; 	b
That clay he feels will not for ever 	b
Come, leave thy dwelling dark and cold, 	b
1 Thus truly, when that breast is cold, 	b
Thy prisoned soul shall rise ; 	b
The dungeon mingle with the mould 	b
Dire region of most mighty woe, 	b
And is her mirror broke at last 	b
Quietly fed in grassy dells ; 	b
One glimpse of that unearthly form 	b
It treads a forest wide, 	b
The ardent, and the happy breast, 	b
The sullen clouds lay all unbroken 	b
And though its wind repining grieved, 	b
For ever on my heart ! 	b
The holly is dark when the rose-brier blooms, 	b
Hopes quenched, and rising thoughts subdued, 	b
* And hope can hardly deck the cheek 	b
And in the zenith of his fame 	b
And just like his its ringlets bright, 	b
Oppressive mystery hung ; 	b
Though wasted sore with sorrow, 	b
What do these brazen tongues proclaim ? 	b
One task alone remains thy pictured face to view, 	b
THE ELDER'S REBUKE 	b
For nothing nearer paradise 	b
Yes, by the tears I Ve poured, 	b
Kneeling on the blood-stained heath 	b
Watch life's bubbles float away : 	b
To rouse its flickering radiance higher ; 	b
Comes on the increasing roar ! 	b
Oh, in the days of ardent youth 	b
Their dark, their deadly ray would more than 	b
Where that perished sapling used to be ; 	b
Remembrance of his early home 	b
Pondered and approved at last : 	b
Thank the power that banished thee ; 	b
* Glorious is the prize of Duty, 	b
Are quenched in morning dull and grey? 	b
Thy comrades to the camp retire ; 	b
Rests such a shade of deep despair, 	b
Youth's early sunshine was poured on his 	b
She sat without the grated den, 	b
A winter's night. 	b
Heedless feet to gulfs of crime. 	b
For those whose bodies rest in sleep, 	b
That from which it sprung Eternity. 	b
When stealing on to lady's bower, 	b
With looks and smiles divine ! 	b
Far down from heaven its silver flood 	b
That wherever I wander, my heart is with thee. 	b
4 The lays I love so well.' 	b
Virtue is not won by fears.' 	b
Thoughts shut within the silent tomb, 	b
So would I fearful vigil keep, 	b
To send to hell my mortal foe. 	b
Walked by the lightsome touch of pleasure : 	b
Had he ne'er met a gentler teacher, 	b
I saw the burning sunshine fall, 	b
In his most burning mood ; 	b
Heavy and dull as lead. 	b
Might haply dawn above ; 	b
Brenzaida's crest is down ; 	b
To leave its clay a little while, 	b
Can take the bliss that has been given, 	b
True to myself, and true to all, 	b
It was not hope that wrecked at once 	b
That never would cloud the world of day. 	b
The cold corpse from its funeral pall, 	b
A glorious child again ; 	b
And draw his tired gaze from futurity ? 	b
And black the piles of rain-clouds lour 	b
That glory-shedding star shall glow 	b
Where sinless sunshine lay : 	b
So softly evening blends with night, 	b
And seek a rough and lonely way ; 	b
First melted off the hope of youth, 	b
Nor mirth, nor music wakes my halls. 	b
They whispered nought, but, ' Lady, sleep, 	b
When it bears my slumbering child. 	b
Strikes the strings resistlesslyt 	b
The deep-down sea with sudden sound 	b
Calm this resentful mood ; 	b
Darkening all my summer skies, 	b
For well he knew what dangers frowned, 	b
All full of God thy features shine. 	b
The glad birds carolled clear ; 	b
Between his port and him. 	b
My name is on a million tongues, 	b
And nothing but that agony 	b
In daisied lawns sleep peacefully, 	b
And solemn, soothing, softened airs, 	b
* Others have been thou mayst be there. ' 	b
Incline thee to my changeful will, 	b
Thank the power that made thee part 	b
Because I could not save. 	b
It recks not now, when all is over : 	b
The woodland park around it spread, 	b
A mourner still, though friend and lover 	b
And there it lightens ! Dashed with gore 	b
We would not leave our nature home 	b
As if through all the 'wildering maze 	b
Time parts the heart of men. 	b
' Dearest, ever deem me true ' ; 	b
And makes the shout of victory 	b
Remoter still am I from Thee j 	b
And on a strange road journeyed on, 	b
might my eyes with tears run o'er ! 	b
And makes me strong to undergo 	b
But cold cold is that resting-place, 	b
Saw those tokens on the ground. 	b
And dear to me, aye doubly dear, 	b
O'er bower and trees that orb divine 	b
Thy eternal Justice found ! 	b
And sworn friends fall from me : 	b
A memory whose blighting beam 	b
The fate was cruel which bore 	b
To see her cheek's returning glow ; 	b
I saw her stand in the gallery long, 	b
Sleep on ; Heaven laughs above, 	b
A noble victory you shall sing 	b
He almost deemed, might have throbbed again 	b
Part human company ; 	b
And render up life's tiresome load. 	b
That by the death of my dearest treasures 	b
Through the wan autumnal sky ; 	b
I saw his hoof-prints mark the rock, 	b
But this shall be the only time 	b
I can tear my soul from its mould of clay, 	b
Hush its whispers in your breast ; 	b
1 should be where I wish to be. 	b
Crushed helpless into earth and Dust ! 	b
Full many an eye watched over me, 	b
Does sudden silence chill the room ? 	b
My whole heart centred there ; 	b
If you forget the sacred vows 	b
Then let me not despair ; 	b
Such as their lips could only pour, 	b
Beneath whose noble dome 	b
Have anchored safe, and rest at last 	b
His dark, keen eyes on Percy gaze 	b
Gone ! 'tis a word which through life's troubled 	b
Say how long my sleep has been ? 	b
Has warmed and blest me long : 	b
Would bring its after-storm of pain. 	b
Shall set my spirit free, 	b
And nerved, like mine, to kill ; 	b
The elm-tree by the haunted well 	b
THE LADY TO HER GUITAR 	b
And green light slept on the happy earth, 	b
I know our souls are all divine, 	b
To wander far away ; 	b
It is stilled above the slain. 	b
Sighing, mourning ever more. 	b
And his fiery heart aroused panting. 	b
Nor hurt thy soul eternally. 	b
Resounded far and near : 	b
These ceaseless tears ! I wish their flow 	b
This voice, though never heard before, 	b
How little fraught with real ill, 	b
And we together sadly sank 	b
The earth as golden, green, and fair, 	b
What joyous fete begun, 	b
And cheerfully go out to play. 	b
HEAVY hangs the rain-drop 	b
Pours black reproach on^me : 	b
Exhaust thy life and hold thee here. 	b
The reckless man would pray ; 	b
Of his unquenched, unclouded blaze, 	b
* Her heart is beating,' Lesley said, 	b
And heavy throbs the young heart 	b
And then I go to prove if God, at least, be true ! 	b
O'er wood and wold o'er flood and fell, 	b
The choking sob, the tortured moan. 	b
I need not yield to care, 	b
So lost that not a gleam may come. 	b
Frowning on the infant, 	b
Whose windows looked on the minster-yard, 	b
A bleak November's calm. 	b
That melancholy boy. 	b
GODS of the old mythology 	b
The stranger would not turn away, 	b
Long ere the poison-tainted air 	b
Chasing angry thought away. 	b
Where thou dost stand an hour ago, 	b
A deeper cup of bitterer pain ; 	b
On golden summer's forests green, 	b
'Twas grief enough to think mankind 	b
It might not be so drear, 	b
Has never wooed to blow, 	b
Scentless are thy petals, 	b
Can watch the lustre leave its skies 	b
The cannon with unceasing crash 	b
Not one voice sobs * farewell ' ; 	b
Barren is thy beauty, 	b
So heaven's sun shines in thee. 	b
Forget, forsake, refuse to hear ! 	b
You both were vainly given : 	b
I saw the light decay. 	b
YET o'er his face a solemn light 	b
Stanzas 5 and 6 have been crossed out in the manuscript. 	b
From trampling on thy buried breast. 	b
And bounding down the marble stair. 	b
That none can pass again. 	b
His banners all bravely flying ; 	b
And cheered his host by adding stern 	b
Why, Seraph, has thine erring wing 	b
Wafted thee down to weep with him ? 	b
IT *s over now ; I Ve known it all ; 	b
Nor do I come to mingle tears ; 	b
But sweet is day, though with shadows 	b
To feel the frost-wind blow ! 	b
Yet the grass before the door 	b
But never more look up and see 	b
Her darling child from her embrace 	b
Will then like virtues shine ; 	b
* Heavy and dark the night is closing ; 	b
Heavy and dark may its bidding be : 	b
May I never tread the hills again. 	b
Or how in exile misery 	b
' Watch in love by a fevered pillow, 	b
When heaven repels my prayer, 	b
Safe as the petrel on tossing billow, 	b
Like summer's sunshine o'er a hill, 	b
( Guardian-angel he lacks no longer ; 	b
From his last hopeless agony, 	b
Eclipsed the glory of the sky, 	b
And my love is truer than angel-care.' 	b
And all the joyous music breathing by, 	b
The place, the hour the same ; 	b
How canst thou linger now ? 	b
And stars were in the depth of blue, 	b
'Tis true she stands among the crowd, 	b
Even so, Guitar, thy magic tone 	b
The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot 	b
And wept above thy fate the more 	b
Flung streaks of moonshine here and there. 	b
Your eyelids droop, a weight is on your brow ; 	b
Woe to the gifted, crime to the giver, 	b
And singing birds and sighing trees, 	b
And dim the hearts that slowly die. 	b
Spent in her Eden Isle 	b
Passed with the ray whose shine it caught ; 	b
What loves me, no word of mine shall e'er betray, 	b
When, severed wide by guiltless gore, 	b
And all their myriad voices 	b
I heard it then, you heard it too, 	b
He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me ; 	b
Strange Power ! I trust thy might ; trust thou my 	b
Looks from its golden frame ; 	b
And that wide west has waked a word 	b
But listen ! The earth is our campaign of war, 	b
Whose sombre portal hides the light, 	b
Clings Percy's wounded spirit so : 	b
I shall not tread again the deep glens where it 	b
The narrow dungeon of the dead, 	b
A silence settled on the room, 	b
Across the waters of despair 	b
And quench the lamp and stir the fire, 	b
Nor, through long hours of future pain, 	b
Her kind face o'er thee shine ? 	b
Have wrapt the parent orb away. 	b
And give me liberty ! ' 	b
Greets no returning summer skies ; 	b
But yet faint not, mournful man ; 	b
And from that world of heavenly light 	b
To guide us in our lifetime's night, 	b
Drowsy and dark my spirit lies, 	b
But, ere night darkened down 	b
Thou wert so bright and fair, 	b
Yet could I with past pleasures 	b
With blue and ghostly gleams, 	b
Remorse even now may wake within 	b
' Well there is rest there, 	b
For there are angels weeping ; 	b
The streets are crowded all, 	b
Our children felt their fathers' wretchedness ; 	b
Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear ; 	b
And curb my own wild will. 	b
True heart and brow unmarked by time, 	b
The law that bade it not defy. 	b
And called on Heaven to aid 	b
With such a fervent zeal, 	b
The clouded forms of long-past history. 	b
It always walks with head declined, 	b
It vexes me to choose another guide : 	b
Their breasts have burst through the battle's 	b
Their ghostly fingers flecked with snow, 	b
What have those lonely mountains worth reveal- 	b
But a wild bird sprang from his hidden lair, 	b
The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling 	b
Though time should change my youthful face, 	b
THE following are the last lines my sister Emily ever wrote. 	b
No coward soul is mine, 	b
AND like myself lone, wholly lone, 	b
I see Heaven's glories shine, 	b
He hears the stream its waters fling ; 	b
I 'M standing in the forest now, 	b
Almighty, ever-present Deity ! 	b
But a brave heart, with a tarnished name, 	b
The splendour of the main, 	b
They did not dare to smile. 	b
That move men's hearts : unutterably vain ; 	b
With windows yawning on intenser gloom, 	b
When thy stream was troubled, did mine calmly 	b
The wind blew fresh and free. 	b
And forms and faces lost for ever 	b
A thousand dreams of mind. 	b
The steadfast rock of immortality. 	b
Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock, 	b
MILD the mist upon the hill, 	b
Pervades and broods above, 	b
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears. 	b
Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh ; 	b
They kindled the perishing ember 	b
And Thou were left alone, 	b
That love, which will the wicked greet 	b
The oath within that caverned hall, 	b
And from the midst of cheerless gloom, 	b
One calm hour on the brink of life 	b
With thy mind's vision pierce the deep, 	b
Eternal midnight there. 	b
OPPRESSED with sin and woe, 	b
And madness cannot feel thy scorn, 	b
I longed to view that bliss divine 	b
And often when the sun declines 	b
The ghastly night, the ghastlier morrow, 	b
Her wavy hair on her shoulders bare, 	b
The burning tears that would keep welling, 	b
That stains our standard green ? 	b
Living in the depth of Heaven ; 	b
As if each gasp were life expelling, 	b
Like sudden ghosts, to memory came 	b
'Tis nothing to eternity : 	b
Mighty heaven, a glad avenger 	b
Death comes on every wind. 	b
That would not mourn the dead. 	b
Thickening above me evermore. 	b
Has neared its final close, 	b
No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn ; 	b
But mutely trace its airy way, 	b
At last refused to mourn. 	b
And summer days again begin 	b
Changing, and still the same, yet swiftly passing. 	b
The wild wind from that wavy main 	b
I never thought to see again. 	b
Bless thee, bright Sea, and glorious dome, 	b
And thinks he of Patrician pride, 	b
My voice is choked, but not with grief, 	b
Bright, but yet sullied, love which could never 	b
I know my mountain breezes 	b
Deepened the gloom of evening's sky, 	b
And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold 	b
The long grass bending where I lay, 	b
And in the heath or mountain far 	b
The goats fly by with timid cry, 	b
His golden days left long behind. 	b
But then it was a calmer woe, 	b
'Tis many a year, 'tis long ago, 	b
A dream of what had been before j 	b
Was that in which the summer sheen 	b
Ungoverned nature madly spurned 	b
Memory of feelings past, 	b
Often I 've sat down on the ground, 	b
Gazing up to the flush scarce seen, 	b
Those bounding breasts that grief should thrill 	b
Then died away, nor came again ; 	b
Thy deep, unutterable woe? 	b
But my sad heart must ever mourn 	b
It sought thy father's home and mine 	b
As I remembered it of old. 	b
And dreamy scents of fragrance pass 	b
Come back the feelings that would swell, 	b
FAR away is the land of rest 	b
They would have done it had they known 	b
Oh ! I shall weary for the light 	b
I howled, and tore my tangled hair ; 	b
Time has turned the bloom to grey, 	b
Lay in unspeakable despair. 	b
of New York in 1902. 	b
Then 'twas first my nursling smiled ; 	b
But both without a murmur there 	b
But her father smiled on the fairest child 	b
WHAT winter floods, what streams of spring 	b
winds coldly mourn 	b
Dead, dead is my joy, 	b
Might embrace in love again ; 	b
To see that water shine ; 	b
But sighing it murmurs, * Let memory perish, 	b
IN the same place, when nature wore 	b
And nothing on the summer gale 	b
The dearest to a mountaineer 	b
For, if your former words were true, 	b
I cannot say my faith is strong, 	b
Now might we doubt God's guardian 	b
Those wondrous southern Isles to hail, 	b
Behold he sinks away ! 	b
LORD of Elbe, on Elbe hill 	b
The mist is thick and the wind is chill ; 	b
More wakeful heart and eyelids grew. 	b
Has sighed for sorrow that thou wert away. 	b
And in his hair the south wind blows, 	b
And hopeless comes its dark decline, 	b
Oh, we are listening for a sound, 	b
Moans as the night gusts over it blow. 	b
Till each far-down reflection is 	b
I see them far off, and it deepens the gloom ; 	b
An undefined, an awful dream, 	b
Where chill, chill whiteness covered all, 	b
In unexhausted woe. 	b
In darkness long concealed, 	b
Would now be tossing under me. 	b
I will not question, only say 	b
But thou art now on the desolate sea, 	b
Regive him shadowy gleams of infancy 	b
Of love too warm, and wild, and bright. 	b
The Herons are flown to their trees by the Hall ; 	b
COLD, clear, and blue the morning heaven 	b
Will give me to a darker doom ; 	b
Through a sky of cloudy grey. 	b
Reflects that winter sky : 	b
In glimpses of a spirit shore 	b
A silent, silvery star. 	b
And I have long forgot to weep. 	b
Sweetly has its dawn begun ; 	b
But the heaven may shake with thunder 	b
Himself restored to infancy? 	b
To leave my lonely halls ! ' 	b
Bless thee, bless all I cannot speak ; 	b
For the moon now beaming mild above 	b
Go, shed thy tears in Ocean's wave 	b
From that wide heaven where every star 	b
IF grief for grief can touch thee, 	b
One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings 	b
Within their perfumed bower, 	b
Of sorrows gathering near, 	b
From her stately form and her features rare, 	b
And young leaves shoot among the fern. 	b
The twilight fading from the skies, 	b
What ! shall they carve on his tomb with the sword 	b
How thou didst turn in mockery 	b
Sparkling in sunshine and in dew, 	b
Had its waters worn the shore. 	b
Methinks the mellowing haze of years 	b
No doubt had marr'd my word ; 	b
TELL me, tell me, smiling child, 	b
What the past is like to thee? 	b
As glancing o'er the moorland track, 	b
Something in that ancestral pride 	b
Tell me what is the present hour? 	b
A green and flowery spray, 	b
Where a young bird sits gathering its power 	b
Your cold hands hardly hold the weary pen : 	b
And what is the future, happy one? 	b
Sunk to peace the twilight breeze : 	b
A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea, 	b
Stretching into infinity. 	b
The inspiring music's thrilling sound, 	b
No, Earth would wish no other sphere 	b
The glittering splendour rising round, 	b
Yet of the native shepherds none, 	b
So stilly round the evening falls ; 	b
To keep my honour fair ; 	b
Covering her brow to hide the tear 	b
The shepherd placed a seat and pressed 	b
From it the torrents flow ? 	b
Never put back that golden flow 	b
That murmur to the breezes' call 	b
The laden bee flew home, 	b
And raised the covering from his brow, 	b
* Nay, call me not ; it may not be ; 	b
Still spoke to me of years gone by ; 	b
Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending ; 	b
Man's spirit away from the drear dungeon sending, 	b
And sound and sight had well combined 	b
All down the mountain-sides wild forests lending 	b
The mighty voice to the life-giving wind ; 	b
With dying torments riven 	b
Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending, 	b
The withering corpse to me. 	b
The busy day has glided by, 	b
For not through age, and not through crime, 	b
Of the golden-gifted time ; 	b
And, Douglas ! thou shalt be 	b
When my sad soul forgot its pride 	b
Since cast from off thine angel brow 	b
Woods, you need not frown on me ; 	b
I have suffered on thro' night and day ; 	b
To know where she is laid. 	b
You need not mock so bitterly. 	b
Thy silvery form, so soft and fair, 	b
I watched how evening took the place 	b
And, far away, down Elmor scars 	b
* The birds that now so blithely sing, 	b
And warms the breezy air. 	b
The waste of youth, the waste of years, 	b
COME walk with me, 	b
And still the words and still the tone 	b
I dream of moor, and misty hill, 	b
In all the hours of gloom 	b
Will find a heart to bear. 	b
WELL narrower draw the circle round, 	b
Laid low in dust their Dryad-hair. 	b
Through the long nights of angry weather, 	b
When parted ghosts might come, 	b
Above their prisoned dust to grieve 	b
Its twilight hours and evenings dark 	b
Whose waves are foaming far and wide. 	b
One gush of ardent prayer. 	b
Forget the hopes of years : 	b
With the radiant red of furnace flames 	b
Senselessly has lain. 	b
To the discord of lute-strings all unstrung. 	b
My robes, and smooth my tangled hair ; 	b
And constant sorrow on my brow 	b
The saints shall shelter thee from harm. 	b
And spread with smiles the evening meal ; 	b
In years by time long left behind ; 	b
TO A WREATH OF SNOW 	b
When I began to pray. 	b
And still it bent above, 	b
They come sailing on, 	b
How oft have I forgot my God, 	b
Yet my heart loves December's smile 	b
That tracks the boundless blue. 	b
Paints her image on the mind. 	b
Of gazing in thine eyes. 	b
And think the fearful vision o'er. 	b
The blossoms to deck my home with the dead. 	b
Tis like the heaven which parting days 	b
The idol chiefs of all. 	b
As if grown weary of the light 	b
When its lips opened and a sound 	b
Awoke the stillness reigning round, 	b
Faint as a dream, but the earth shrank, 	b
And truly like a god she seems, 	b
Woe for the day ! Regina's pride, 	b
Retracing back her lifetime flown ; 	b
And thus in strange response he spoke. 	b
The circling hills to kiss. 	b
Where fairer forms in darkness lie ; 	b
That time is treasuring up for me. 	b
Sound through the granite glen ; 	b
All vague and undefined ? 	b
That sad lament was ringing ; 	b
Twill break for thee. 	b
Such dreamy, dreary singing. 	b
Aware her last hour approaching fast, 	b
Of mirror broken on the grass, 	b
Watch for a bird with sable wing, 	b
And weaker minds would fear. 	b
I listened to thy mournful sighing. 	b
Were by a faint breeze blown ; 	b
I knew the source whence sprung those tears 	b
They raise their eyes, for the sunny skies 	b
Reveal ; where o'er a lone green wood 	b
How well my spirit knows the path 	b
Was given me in that silent hour 	b
In a yeoman's home-close grew ; 	b
In cell and cloister drear ; 	b
At last the sunshine left the ground, 	b
The bright blue flowers and velvet sod, 	b
Were strange conductors to the bowers 	b
I need not fear my foes, 	b
Aid for that which lies before. 	b
In a grave that never shuts its dead 	b
Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface 	b
In cloudy morning clothed the sky. 	b
Come, sit down on this sunny stone ; 	b
I saw His wisdom infinite, 	b
In her uncovered eye ; 	b
But beneath the earth is midnight 	b
Waiting to hear the lingering feet 	b
And whistles round the gloomy wall, 	b
And lingering long, and thinking grieves, 	b
How it longed how it burned to be free ! 	b
And no one laughed, and none seemed free from 	b
He wakens, and how ghastly white 	b
By whom all things were made ; 	b
So, resting on a heathy bank, 	b
And will sustain when thou art gone. 	b
me mourn ; 	b
An anguish in his bosom now ; 	b
COMPANIONS all day long we 've stood 	b
Fixed strainedly on the vacant air ; 	b
His wisdom so divine, 	b
Weak, wretched sinner though I be, 	b
Sleeping silently and still, 	b
On Eversham's woody brow. 	b
That living, is not nobler now 	b
Too full to hide their tears, too stern to overflow ; 	b
To see the sunshine disappear ; 	b
The breeze sings like a summer breeze 	b
Then silent weep J cannot weep, 	b
Cut off from hope in early day, 	b
From earth and glory cut away. 	b
That haunts his feudal home ; 	b
Must image forth the scowl of night, 	b
And childhood's flower must waste its bloom 	b
Beneath the shadow of the tomb. 	b
Though vengeance held a sheathed sword 	b
And still did evening fall ; 	b
Through infinite immensity. 	b
Wave gently round her head. 	b
Tells what once those features were, 	b
By that celestial shine I 	b
And the dying their last watch were keeping 	b
Let us be laid in lasting rest, 	b
Lost their robes of tender green ? 	b
That I should greet approaching feet, 	b
Half the sweet, the haunting smile ; 	b
Other desires and other hopes beset me, 	b
There is a voice in the wind that waves 	b
And pleasure tune its chords again. 	b
And my eyes cannot hold the tears 	b
Was it some feeling of delight, 	b
From the time of morning's earliest dew 	b
Blasts with that oath his perjured soul, 	b
Kindle a short and bitter smile, 	b
The sun of evening died, 	b
Sleep, stilly sleep, thou bright-haired child, 	b
Its large dark eyes of shadowy light, 	b
Waveless and calm lies that silent deep 	b
They fleck with shade our mountains bright 	b
A little longer in this reverie : 	b
Upon its heathy shores. 	b
But not a dream of sleep ; 	b
Ah ! could my hand unlock its chain, 	b
Were off like light again. 	b
For every torturing tear. 	b
And chained was every tongue. 	b
To mourn o'er what I mourn. 	b
God ! bless her sun with victory, 	b
In some warm nook a couch to find. 	b
strong and far : 	b
Fluttering from the autumn tree. 	b
That through the shadows shone 	b
The languid lid would close, 	b
Though I no more may watchful bend 	b
Through dreams where startling imagery 	b
Can no memory now recall 	b
Home to their journey's end ; 	b
ALONE I sat ; the summer day 	b
Had died in smiling light away ; 	b
Returning to my breast again. 	b
For past misery are we weeping? 	b
I will sail the desert sea. 	b
Roams in the dawn of day ; 	b
The harvest-moon looks down ; 	b
Look on those woods, look on that mountain lorn, 	b
I '11 hide it in my heart no more, 	b
Then why is all so sad and lone? 	b
How invincible its roar, 	b
A shattered wreck on ocean's tide, 	b
But that at Ambition's bidding, 	b
The heart so long endeared to thee, 	b
Are you a hawk to follow the prey, 	b
Till death shall sound his signal cry, 	b
Visions by ardent fancy fed 	b
And yet a dreamlike comfort came 	b
But now, when I had hoped to sing, 	b
My fingers strike a tuneless string ; 	b
Who bound us in one vigorous whole 	b
Still clung she to his bridle rein 	b
Yet have I read these falcon eyes, 	b
He faintly prayed, < O Death, delay 	b
But a tyrant spell has bound me, 	b
'Tis like old age pretending 	b
Roofless, crumbling to the ground ; 	b
Their bare boughs weighed with snow, 	b
We both together struck the blow ; 	b
And yet I cannot go. 	b
OH, all the cares these noontide airs 	b
Wastes beyond wastes below ; 	b
When the sun first crowned the hill, 	b
Beneath these sullen skies? 	b
I 'LL come when thou art saddest, 	b
Bring light to the darkened room, 	b
When the rude day's mirth has vanished, 	b
Spirit of bliss ! what brings thee here, 	b
Long he gazed and held his breath, 	b
I '11 come when the heart's worst feeling 	b
Has entire, unbiassed sway, 	b
But some I read so well, 	b
And gives to fancy magic power 	b
It was a summer day that saw 	b
Listen ! 'tis just the hour, 	b
But who reads not through the tender glow 	b
But thank your passion not for me ! 	b
A flood of strange sensations roll, 	b
Forerunners of a sterner power, 	b
Heralds of me? 	b
THE soft unclouded blue of air, 	b
Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke 	b
How daredst thou wake thoughts in me, 	b
And lived upon this weary Earth 	b
But then I knew that he stood free, 	b
Was it the smile of early spring 	b
And then I felt . . . \unfinished\. 	b
Now trust a heart that trusts in you, 	b
Douglas leaned above the well ; 	b
And may not be forgiven. 	b
My heart is with your heart at home ; 	b
cold, cold is my heart ! 	b
We both were scorned, both sternly driven 	b
Over his own unhappy soul ; 	b
Unless I change in every thought, 	b
And memory will restore me nought, 	b
Look now she rests below, 	b
The clouds are earthward yearning ; 	b
The smothering snow-clouds rolled away ; 	b
The barren mountain-side lies bare, 	b
He would not give one moorland wild 	b
As shines earth's sun in summer noon 	b
And whiter brows than yours may be, 	b
Where city walls spread wide around 	b
And lightning looks from orbs divine 	b
About my pathway burn and shine. 	b
But that pure light, changeless and strong, 	b
That last dim beam that sets for thee, 	b
Echoing to their bells. 	b
My feeble faith still clings to Thee. 	b
When we were wont to burst away 	b
Remembrance never dies, 	b
From hope, and peace, and power, and 	b
Her former life's eventful day 	b
Know nought akin to our despair ; 	b
Without a voice to speak to you 	b
For that mist may break when the sun is high, 	b
For bygone griefs and dried-up tears. 	b
In open day and cheerful sun, 	b
Lord Lesley, let it free ; 	b
Waiting the death that was to come. 	b
On which it ought to wend. 	b
Sleep brings no strength to me, 	b
Must claim from Justice lasting rest ; 	b
Youth's warm affections gave, 	b
To meet its early tomb ? 	b
Mad though that anguish be, 	b
As warm as middle June. 	b
And yet it seems a dreary moor, 	b
Was heavier far than earth can be ; 	b
A shelter from the sky. 	b
And never Fejian devotee 	b
My only wish is to forget 	b
In endless sleep of death. 	b
Fireless hearths, and lifeless homes ; 	b
Had they but seen their idol then, 	b
Strong I stand, and laugh to see 	b
That leaf from its parent tree ; 	b
Shut out from joy and liberty, 	b
All the puny ways of men ; 	b
The first to fight, the last to fall, 	b
Then come again ; thou wilt not shrink 	b
The glory of the festal day, 	b
Ought for a moment to be mine : 	b
Affrightened from that ceaseless roar. 	b
Beneath its mighty glare : 	b
Thing of Dust, with boundless pride, 	b
Dare you ask me for a guide ? 	b
Will hardly let her gleam, 	b
Or any, but an exile's doom. 	b
Windows through whose broken panes the night- 	b
To free the world from tyrant's chain, 	b
For which we fought and bled and died. 	b
I saw her give th' unanswered kiss 	b
Full soon divided him from me. 	b
Where their bright glories shone at first. 	b
To shelter 'neath a foreign heaven ; 	b
Till far beyond earth's frenzied strife, 	b
That should startle the nations that rest around. 	b
What pleasant airs upon her face 	b
Confused and strange and drear. 	b
She sits and fondly seems to trace 	b
And never more at early dawning 	b
And I must see the final gloom 	b
The accursed man shall be ; 	b
Dear childhood's innocence forgive, 	b
And my eye can wander through worlds of light. 	b
Methinks their chime sounds faint and drear, 	b
My lids closed down, yet through their veil 	b
The glory of a summer sky. 	b
And form my mood to Nature's mood. 	b
The tiny ripples flame. 	b
Went, and ne'er returned again ! 	b
I cannot bear to go away. 	b
May beam the blaze of July's sun, 	b
To soothe your grief or calm your care ; 	b
Nay, do not weep ; that bitter mourning 	b
And man's remarks or sighs or scorn, 	b
Full many a heart, that in the tomb, 	b
For ever dark, for ever cold. 	b
You '11 dry your tears and check your sighing, 	b
Lie low and lone the silent dead ; 	b
FALL, leaves, fall ; die, flowers, away ; 	b
If I were quite alone, 	b
One ripple in the lovely lake ; 	b
Lost, cursed, degraded all for thee ! 	b
There are bones whitening there in the 	b
Fernando left his home and you, 	b
And still I think you must remember 	b
Marking my despondency. 	b
Lit by the evening flame, 	b
I longed to see his face again, 	b
From his daylong dream at once he woke ; 	b
Better that I my own fate mourning, 	b
Except for you, my dearest queen ! 	b
There lies a lone and lovely glade, 	b
And there the hearts together nourished, 	b
Since parted from thee I am left alone, 	b
The afternoon in softened glory 	b
In the old church beneath the stone, 	b
And the broad park spread before me 	b
And curse instead of pray. 	b
And there I stood when he had left me, 	b
With ashy cheek and tearless eye, 	b
Watching the ship whose sail bereft me 	b
In gathering gloom in every glade, 	b
By the wild storm blasts roughly broke, 	b
O may I never lose the peace 	b
My soul still bounded o'er the billow, 	b
The curtains waved, the wakened flies 	b
The azure flowers where they were nursed, 	b
One brief glimpse to thine eye, I 	b
Its much-desired repose. 	b
Of safe deliverance from the sea. 	b
Yet, alas ! the sooner turning 	b
And drowned my bloom of youth in tears. 	b
And time at length brought power for coping 	b
With thoughts I could not once endure. 	b
MAY flowers are opening, 	b
The place that saw our last farewell, 	b
Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe, 	b
In plundered churches piled with dead 	b
Go out upon the breezy moor ; 	b
AWAKE, awake ! how loud the stormy morning 	b
Calls up to life the nation's resting round ; 	b
What follows in Ula's garden sweet 	b
And violet and wild woodrose 	b
One whisper, one sweet dream in him, 	b
' Twill only yield another sight 	b
That while the world was lost to her 	b
A beam of glory there, 	b
It was cultured by another hand, 	b
A traitor's perjury. 	b
And her look of Majesty. 	b
The sea-green standard lies in dust beneath. 	b
To which my own was given ; 	b
Soldiers, preserve that glory bright and free ; 	b
It was just the time of eve, 	b
Let me remember half the woes 	b
Are but the shattered glass 	b
Can still the spirit's storm ; 	b
While thou canst speak with such a tone ! 	b
But how can I live lonely here? 	b
From turret, tower and wall. 	b
And prone to every sin ; 	b
And in the haze of glorious light 	b
I have sat lonely all the day, 	b
In the pure light of childhood's morn, 	b
Where blackbird and the throstle dwell ; 	b
Save that deep gong which tolled my 	b
A thousand strains of Music swell. 	b
For God alone doth know how blessed 	b
And every listener swears it true ; 	b
And tell me, why such blessed sleep 	b
Unlike the bloom I like to see. 	b
So full of soul, so deeply sweet ; 	b
The grave must close those limbs around, 	b
The moonbeam and the storm, 	b
While the wind is whispering only, 	b
Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim. 	b
How can I break these iron chains, 	b
Are the hours to come, the joyless hours, 	b
With beams of such impartial blaze, 	b
It chained the snow-swollen streams no more. 	b
And they will reach it soon. 	b
And then a sudden flash of flame, 	b
And leave my human feelings 	b
Into my heart and anxious eye, 	b
Then his eyes began to weary, 	b
Amid the howling storm of war? 	b
care and tears and pain. 	b
But coldly breaks November's day ; 	b
But hate eternally. 1 	b
Eldenna's waves are rolling red, 	b
Shade of history, I condemn 	b
If my spirit's eye can see, 	b
And deeper green is on the hill. 	b
I looked out to see her there, 	b
They all are held in me ; 	b
And all seem glad their voice to hear ; 	b
Wisdom, scorned, knows no relenting ; 	b
A tear might flow, ay, many a tear, 	b
And there in those wild bowers 	b
No whisper, not to me ; 	b
I could not sleep through that wild siege, 	b
I know that I have done thee wrong, 	b
And mourned a love for ever flown. 	b
Sank back again to childhood's day ; 	b
Its cheering smile to see, 	b
That sin was purified by woe. 	b
Your worlds of solemn light, again, 	b
To us, in unimagined bloom, 	b
And she springs up in haste to greet 	b
And thou art near thy prime? 	b
It was a pleasant April day 	b
So I knew that he was dying 	b
Watching the drizzly mist descend, 	b
Descend like rain upon the heath. 	b
Its deadly mist o'er joys and cares. 	b
Held by the mountain men. 	b
Like bandit-knife was hung. 	b
And what shall change that angel brow, 	b
To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region ; 	b
Laid on the grass I lapsed away, 	b
Blend with a song of troubled times. 	b
To seize the falling rein. 	b
Thus thy first hour's course shall be : 	b
With voice subdued and steady look, 	b
Spring grass grows green and fair ; 	b
Call Death yes Death he is mine own, 	b
To live in every sweetest thought ; 	b
And sweeter than a flute's reply 	b
Where royal corpses lay. 	b
And there was eastern incense burnt, 	b
For sun, before they close, 	b
In mercy launch one arrow more ; 	b
With sacred halos round it shed ? 	b
But death has stolen our company, 	b
And words upon the breezes hung. 	b
Its sufferings and its tears. 	b
' Bless it ! My gracious God ! ' I cried. 	b
Welcome at last, though once so drear. 	b
Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish 	b
Shall our feet forget the way ? 	b
Vainly would man divine or tell. 	b
STRONG I stand, though I have borne 	b
Look how in sable gloom 	b
A darker wave. 	b
Glows o'er the graves of Elrington, 	b
It was about the middle night 	b
So their fond hearts were free, 	b
The shallow wrecks of memories 	b
Looks down on the descending sun ; 	b
Thou art my intimate delight, 	b
Deep secrets of His Providence 	b
It pines in cold captivity, 	b
One penance tender tears. 	b
HINDER me by no delay ! 	b
He dared not say me nay the hinges harshly turn. 	b
Yonder they stand and watch the waves 	b
What have I now? The star that brightly 	b
Dry thine eyes, too ; 'tis vain to keep 	b
HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES 	b
Now seems as nothing in the single cloud 	b
That laid my best affections low, 	b
That thou wouldst call to mind. 	b
And yet, a king, though Prudence well 	b
My horse had strayed, I cannot say ; 	b
Zamorna is this nobly done, 	b
But could the day seem dark to me 	b
Those tones were softer than the moan 	b
Has passed from summer's heaven divine, 	b
I ask for nothing further here 	b
From the side of the wintry brae. 	b
I should not be if that were gone 	b
YES, holy be thy resting-place 	b
THROUGH the hours of yesternight 	b
She murmured with a sigh. 	b
And nations round are fearing, 	b
So humbly by her side ; 	b
That set on fire my heart, but froze upon my 	b
An icy glory caught mine eye, 	b
O come away ! The Norman door 	b
And my glad heart bound wilder still. 	b
From his heart's fountain swell, 	b
My hour of rest had fleeted by, 	b
Toss up the window's velvet veil, 	b
What is past can hurt no more ; 	b
To sit within this Norman door, 	b
No : that I feel can never be ; 	b
* Angora's hills have heard their tread, 	b
* Well, thou hast fought for many a year, 	b
Like youth, to my maturer eyes, 	b
She sees us, sister, now ; 	b
And I have sat and watched the trees, 	b
Their glory-haloed crown to wear. 	b
And merry words to whispers die, 	b
Whose forms have troubled me, 	b
The woods and fields and golden flowers 	b
That we must bind thee down and clench thy 	b
Is welcome as a friend ; 	b
Though earth and man were gone, 	b
False and foolish mortal know, 	b
I 've trod a dark and frightful way. 	b
As kindly as the good. 	b
The pure blue heaven with clouds of gold ; 	b
Though not for fear, though not for shame. 	b
Which shapeless figures on each piece 	b
Those eyes shall make my only day, 	b
As long as thou, the solemn night, 	b
My outward sense is gone, my inward essence 	b
And the crags where I wandered of old. 	b
Joins the mad world in all its scorn. 	b
Bore his soul from earth away. 	b
Then why lament that those we love 	b
And wild birds bursting from their songless nest, 	b
But yet it was a glorious sun, 	b
When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes 	b
What my soul bore, my soul alone 	b
Have studied long their glance and feel 	b
And all my prospect of relief 	b
His heart is stirred through all its strings, 	b
And then a wakening from above ; 	b
As it tossed against the heaven, 	b
From fairest creatures we desire increase,	s
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:	s
His tender heir might bear his memory:	s
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	s
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	s
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	s
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	s
And only herald to the gaudy spring,	s
Within thine own bud buriest thy content	s
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	s
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	s
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	s
When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,	s
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,	s
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,	s
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:	s
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,	s
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,	s
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,	s
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.	s
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine	s
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'	s
Proving his beauty by succession thine!	s
This were to be new made when thou art old,	s
Now is the time that face should form another;	s
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,	s
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.	s
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb	s
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?	s
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb	s
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee	s
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:	s
So thou through windows of thine age shall see	s
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.	s
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,	s
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.	s
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend	s
Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:	s
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,	s
And being frank she lends to those are free.	s
The bounteous largess given thee to give?	s
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use	s
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?	s
For having traffic with thyself alone,	s
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.	s
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,	s
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?	s
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,	s
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.	s
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame	s
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,	s
Will play the tyrants to the very same	s
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:	s
For never-resting time leads summer on	s
To hideous winter and confounds him there;	s
Sap check'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,	s
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:	s
Then, were not summer's distillation left,	s
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:	s
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,	s
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.	s
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface	s
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:	s
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place	s
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.	s
That use is not forbidden usury,	s
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;	s
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;	s
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,	s
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:	s
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,	s
Leaving thee living in posterity?	s
Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair	s
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light	s
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye	s
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,	s
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;	s
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,	s
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,	s
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,	s
Attending on his golden pilgrimage;	s
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,	s
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,	s
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are	s
From his low tract and look another way:	s
So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,	s
Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.	s
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?	s
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.	s
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,	s
That is so proud thy service to despise,	s
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest	s
By unions married, do offend thine ear,	s
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds	s
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.	s
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,	s
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,	s
Resembling sire and child and happy mother	s
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:	s
Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,	s
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'	s
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye	s
That thou consumest thyself in single life?	s
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.	s
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;	s
The world will be thy widow and still weep	s
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,	s
When every private widow well may keep	s
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.	s
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend	s
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;	s
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,	s
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.	s
No love toward others in that bosom sits	s
That on himself such murderous shame commits.	s
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,	s
And so the general of hot desire	s
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,	s
But that thou none lovest is most evident;	s
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate	s
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.	s
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	s
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.	s
'I hate' from hate away she threw,	s
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	s
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,	s
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:	s
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.	s
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest	s
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;	s
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.	s
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:	s
If all were minded so, the times should cease	s
And threescore year would make the world away.	s
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,	s
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:	s
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby	s
Those lips that Love's own hand did make	s
When I do count the clock that tells the time,	s
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;	s
When I behold the violet past prime,	s
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves	s
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,	s
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves	s
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,	s
Then of thy beauty do I question make,	s
That thou among the wastes of time must go,	s
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake	s
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence	s
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.	s
O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are	s
No longer yours than you yourself here live:	s
Against this coming end you should prepare,	s
And your sweet semblance to some other give.	s
Find no determination: then you were	s
Yourself again after yourself's decease,	s
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,	s
Which husbandry in honour might uphold	s
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day	s
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?	s
O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know	s
You had a father: let your son say so.	s
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;	s
And yet methinks I have astronomy,	s
But not to tell of good or evil luck,	s
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;	s
Making a famine where abundance lies,	s
Or say with princes if it shall go well,	s
By oft predict that I in heaven find:	s
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,	s
And, constant stars, in them I read such art	s
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;	s
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:	s
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.	s
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;	s
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	s
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;	s
Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky,	s
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,	s
And wear their brave state out of memory;	s
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay	s
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,	s
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,	s
To change your day of youth to sullied night;	s
And all in war with Time for love of you,	s
But wherefore do not you a mightier way	s
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?	s
And fortify yourself in your decay	s
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	s
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,	s
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	s
So should the lines of life that life repair,	s
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,	s
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;	s
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.	s
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,	s
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.	s
Who will believe my verse in time to come,	s
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb	s
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.	s
If I could write the beauty of your eyes	s
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,	s
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:	s
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'	s
So should my papers yellow'd with their age	s
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,	s
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	s
But were some child of yours alive that time,	s
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?	s
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	s
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	s
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:	s
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	s
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	s
And every fair from fair sometime declines,	s
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	s
But thy eternal summer shall not fade	s
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;	s
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	s
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:	s
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	s
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.	s
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,	s
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;	s
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,	s
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;	s
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,	s
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,	s
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;	s
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:	s
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,	s
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;	s
Him in thy course untainted do allow	s
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.	s
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,	s
My love shall in my verse ever live young.	s
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted	s
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;	s
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted	s
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;	s
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,	s
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;	s
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,	s
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.	s
And for a woman wert thou first created;	s
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,	s
And by addition me of thee defeated,	s
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.	s
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,	s
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.	s
So is it not with me as with that Muse	s
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,	s
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	s
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	s
Making a couplement of proud compare,	s
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,	s
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare	s
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,	s
And then believe me, my love is as fair	s
To make me give the lie to my true sight,	s
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:	s
Let them say more than like of hearsay well;	s
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.	s
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,	s
So long as youth and thou are of one date;	s
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,	s
Then look I death my days should expiate.	s
For all that beauty that doth cover thee	s
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,	s
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:	s
How can I then be elder than thou art?	s
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary	s
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;	s
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary	s
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	s
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;	s
Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.	s
As an unperfect actor on the stage	s
And taught it thus anew to greet:	s
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	s
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.	s
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say	s
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	s
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,	s
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.	s
O, let my books be then the eloquence	s
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	s
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.	s
O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:	s
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;	s
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	s
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;	s
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	s
And perspective it is the painter's art.	s
For through the painter must you see his skill,	s
To find where your true image pictured lies;	s
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	s
But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;	s
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,	s
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me	s
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;	s
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;	s
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.	s
Let those who are in favour with their stars	s
Of public honour and proud titles boast,	s
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,	s
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.	s
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread	s
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	s
And in themselves their pride lies buried,	s
The painful warrior famoused for fight,	s
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	s
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:	s
Then happy I, that love and am beloved	s
Where I may not remove nor be removed.	s
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage	s
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,	s
To witness duty, not to show my wit:	s
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	s
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,	s
But that I hope some good conceit of thine	s
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;	s
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	s
Points on me graciously with fair aspect	s
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,	s
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:	s
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;	s
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.	s
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,	s
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;	s
But then begins a journey in my head,	s
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:	s
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,	s
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,	s
Looking on darkness which the blind do see	s
Save that my soul's imaginary sight	s
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,	s
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,	s
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.	s
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,	s
For thee and for myself no quiet find.	s
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,	s
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?	s
But found no cure: the bath for my help lies	s
But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?	s
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;	s
The one by toil, the other to complain	s
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.	s
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright	s
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.	s
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,	s
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.	s
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse	s
And night doth nightly make grief's strength	s
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,	s
I all alone beweep my outcast state	s
And look upon myself and curse my fate,	s
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	s
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,	s
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,	s
With what I most enjoy contented least;	s
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,	s
Like to the lark at break of day arising	s
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.	s
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	s
I summon up remembrance of things past,	s
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,	s
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:	s
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,	s
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,	s
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:	s
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,	s
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	s
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	s
O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,	s
All losses are restored and sorrows end.	s
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	s
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,	s
And all those friends which I thought buried.	s
How many a holy and obsequious tear	s
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye	s
As interest of the dead, which now appear	s
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!	s
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,	s
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;	s
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,	s
Their images I loved I view in thee,	s
And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.	s
If thou survive my well-contented day,	s
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,	s
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey	s
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,	s
Compare them with the bettering of the time,	s
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,	s
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,	s
Exceeded by the height of happier men.	s
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:	s
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,	s
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,	s
To march in ranks of better equipage:	s
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,	s
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'	s
Full many a glorious morning have I seen	s
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,	s
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,	s
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;	s
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride	s
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,	s
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:	s
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,	s
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;	s
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.	s
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;	s
Revenge upon myself with present moan?	s
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,	s
And make me travel forth without my cloak,	s
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,	s
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?	s
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,	s
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,	s
For no man well of such a salve can speak	s
The fairest votary took up that fire	s
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:	s
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief	s
To him that bears the strong offence's cross.	s
Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,	s
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.	s
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;	s
All men make faults, and even I in this,	s
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,	s
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;	s
Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.	s
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--	s
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:	s
Such civil war is in my love and hate	s
That I an accessary needs must be	s
Desire is death, which physic did except.	s
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	s
So shall those blots that do with me remain	s
Without thy help by me be borne alone.	s
In our two loves there is but one respect,	s
Though in our lives a separable spite,	s
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,	s
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.	s
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,	s
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,	s
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:	s
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend	s
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s
As a decrepit father takes delight	s
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,	s
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.	s
Or any of these all, or all, or more,	s
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,	s
I make my love engrafted to this store:	s
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,	s
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give	s
That I in thy abundance am sufficed	s
And by a part of all thy glory live.	s
When I against myself with thee partake?	s
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!	s
How can my Muse want subject to invent,	s
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse	s
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent	s
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?	s
O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me	s
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;	s
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,	s
When thou thyself dost give invention light?	s
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth	s
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;	s
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth	s
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.	s
If my slight Muse do please these curious days,	s
O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,	s
When thou art all the better part of me?	s
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?	s
And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?	s
Even for this let us divided live,	s
And our dear love lose name of single one,	s
That by this separation I may give	s
That due to thee which thou deservest alone.	s
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,	s
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave	s
O, though I love what others do abhor,	s
And that thou teachest how to make one twain,	s
By praising him here who doth hence remain!	s
When all my best doth worship thy defect,	s
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?	s
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.	s
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,	s
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,	s
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;	s
But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest	s
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.	s
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,	s
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;	s
And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief	s
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.	s
Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,	s
Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,	s
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,	s
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,	s
For still temptation follows where thou art.	s
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,	s
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;	s
And when a woman woos, what woman's son	s
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?	s
Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,	s
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,	s
Who lead thee in their riot even there	s
Or made them swear against the thing they see;	s
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,	s
That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,	s
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;	s
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.	s
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:	s
Within be fed, without be rich no more:	s
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,	s
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.	s
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,	s
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;	s
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,	s
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:	s
But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;	s
Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.	s
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,	s
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,	s
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.	s
I guess one angel in another's hell:	s
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,	s
By looking on thee in the living day,	s
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade	s
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	s
All days are nights to see till I see thee,	s
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.	s
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,	s
Injurious distance should not stop my way;	s
For then despite of space I would be brought,	s
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,	s
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;	s
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land	s
As soon as think the place where he would be.	s
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,	s
But that so much of earth and water wrought	s
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,	s
Receiving nought by elements so slow	s
But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.	s
The other two, slight air and purging fire,	s
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;	s
The first my thought, the other my desire,	s
These present-absent with swift motion slide.	s
Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?	s
In tender embassy of love to thee,	s
My life, being made of four, with two alone	s
Until life's composition be recured	s
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,	s
Who even but now come back again, assured	s
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:	s
This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,	s
I send them back again and straight grow sad.	s
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war	s
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;	s
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,	s
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.	s
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--	s
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--	s
But the defendant doth that plea deny	s
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.	s
To 'cide this title is impanneled	s
The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:	s
As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,	s
And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.	s
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,	s
And each doth good turns now unto the other:	s
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,	s
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,	s
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast	s
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;	s
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest	s
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:	s
So, either by thy picture or my love,	s
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,	s
And I am still with them and they with thee;	s
Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight	s
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,	s
How careful was I, when I took my way,	s
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,	s
That to my use it might unused stay	s
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!	s
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,	s
Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,	s
Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,	s
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?	s
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,	s
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,	s
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;	s
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;	s
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,	s
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.	s
Against that time, if ever that time come,	s
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,	s
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,	s
Call'd to that audit by advised respects;	s
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,	s
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.	s
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,	s
Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--	s
Against that time do I ensconce me here	s
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,	s
And this my hand against myself uprear,	s
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:	s
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,	s
Since why to love I can allege no cause.	s
How heavy do I journey on the way,	s
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,	s
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say	s
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,	s
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,	s
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,	s
As if by some instinct the wretch did know	s
His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:	s
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on	s
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;	s
Which heavily he answers with a groan,	s
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;	s
For that same groan doth put this in my mind;	s
My grief lies onward and my joy behind.	s
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence	s
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:	s
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?	s
Till I return, of posting is no need.	s
O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,	s
When swift extremity can seem but slow?	s
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;	s
In winged speed no motion shall I know:	s
Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;	s
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;	s
Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,	s
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,	s
The which he will not every hour survey,	s
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.	s
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,	s
Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,	s
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,	s
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.	s
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,	s
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,	s
To make some special instant special blest,	s
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.	s
Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,	s
What is your substance, whereof are you made,	s
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?	s
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,	s
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,	s
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit	s
Is poorly imitated after you;	s
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,	s
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:	s
Speak of the spring and foison of the year;	s
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,	s
The other as your bounty doth appear;	s
And you in every blessed shape we know.	s
In all external grace you have some part,	s
But you like none, none you, for constant heart.	s
O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem	s
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!	s
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem	s
For that sweet odour which doth in it live.	s
The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye	s
If it be not, then love doth well denote	s
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly	s
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:	s
But, for their virtue only is their show,	s
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,	s
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;	s
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:	s
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,	s
When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.	s
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments	s
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;	s
Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.	s
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,	s
And broils root out the work of masonry,	s
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn	s
The living record of your memory.	s
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity	s
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room	s
Even in the eyes of all posterity	s
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.	s
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,	s
You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.	s
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said	s
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,	s
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,	s
To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:	s
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,	s
To-morrow see again, and do not kill	s
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.	s
Let this sad interim like the ocean be	s
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new	s
Come daily to the banks, that, when they see	s
Return of love, more blest may be the view;	s
Else call it winter, which being full of care	s
Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.	s
Being your slave, what should I do but tend	s
I have no precious time at all to spend,	s
Nor services to do, till you require.	s
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour	s
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,	s
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour	s
When you have bid your servant once adieu;	s
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought	s
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,	s
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep	s
So true a fool is love that in your will,	s
Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.	s
That god forbid that made me first your slave,	s
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,	s
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,	s
To me that languish'd for her sake;	s
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,	s
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;	s
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,	s
Without accusing you of injury.	s
Be where you list, your charter is so strong	s
That you yourself may privilege your time	s
To what you will; to you it doth belong	s
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.	s
I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;	s
For, thou betraying me, I do betray	s
If there be nothing new, but that which is	s
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,	s
Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss	s
The second burden of a former child!	s
O, that record could with a backward look,	s
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,	s
Show me your image in some antique book,	s
To this composed wonder of your frame;	s
Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,	s
To subjects worse have given admiring praise.	s
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,	s
So do our minutes hasten to their end;	s
Each changing place with that which goes before,	s
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.	s
Nativity, once in the main of light,	s
Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,	s
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.	s
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth	s
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,	s
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,	s
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:	s
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,	s
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet	s
Is it thy will thy image should keep open	s
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?	s
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,	s
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?	s
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee	s
So far from home into my deeds to pry,	s
To find out shames and idle hours in me,	s
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:	s
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;	s
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,	s
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.	s
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	s
From me far off, with others all too near.	s
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye	s
And all my soul and all my every part;	s
And for this sin there is no remedy,	s
It is so grounded inward in my heart.	s
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,	s
No shape so true, no truth of such account;	s
And for myself mine own worth do define,	s
As I all other in all worths surmount.	s
But when my glass shows me myself indeed,	s
Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,	s
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;	s
Self so self-loving were iniquity.	s
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot	s
Painting my age with beauty of thy days.	s
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,	s
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow	s
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn	s
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,	s
And all those beauties whereof now he's king	s
Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,	s
Stealing away the treasure of his spring;	s
For such a time do I now fortify	s
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,	s
That he shall never cut from memory	s
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,	s
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,	s
And they shall live, and he in them still green.	s
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced	s
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;	s
But since he died and poets better prove,	s
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;	s
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	s
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,	s
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?	s
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;	s
When I have seen such interchange of state,	s
No matter then although my foot did stand	s
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,	s
That Time will come and take my love away.	s
Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.	s
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.	s
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,	s
There is such strength and warrantize of skill	s
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,	s
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?	s
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out	s
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,	s
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?	s
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,	s
With insufficiency my heart to sway?	s
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?	s
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?	s
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,	s
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.	s
As, to behold desert a beggar born,	s
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,	s
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,	s
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,	s
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,	s
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,	s
And strength by limping sway disabled,	s
And art made tongue-tied by authority,	s
And folly doctor-like controlling skill,	s
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,	s
And captive good attending captain ill:	s
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,	s
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.	s
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,	s
And with his presence grace impiety,	s
That sin by him advantage should achieve	s
And lace itself with his society?	s
Why should false painting imitate his cheek	s
And steal dead seeing of his living hue?	s
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek	s
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?	s
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,	s
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?	s
And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.	s
O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had	s
In days long since, before these last so bad.	s
Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.	s
Before the bastard signs of fair were born,	s
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;	s
Before the golden tresses of the dead,	s
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,	s
To live a second life on second head;	s
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:	s
In him those holy antique hours are seen,	s
Without all ornament, itself and true,	s
Making no summer of another's green,	s
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;	s
And him as for a map doth Nature store,	s
To show false Art what beauty was of yore.	s
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view	s
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;	s
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,	s
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.	s
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;	s
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own	s
In other accents do this praise confound	s
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.	s
They look into the beauty of thy mind,	s
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,	s
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,	s
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,	s
The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.	s
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,	s
And all my honest faith in thee is lost,	s
The ornament of beauty is suspect,	s
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.	s
So thou be good, slander doth but approve	s
Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;	s
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,	s
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.	s
Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,	s
My love is as a fever, longing still	s
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,	s
If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,	s
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.	s
No longer mourn for me when I am dead	s
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell	s
Give warning to the world that I am fled	s
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:	s
Nay, if you read this line, remember not	s
The hand that writ it; for I love you so	s
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot	s
If thinking on me then should make you woe.	s
O, if, I say, you look upon this verse	s
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,	s
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.	s
But let your love even with my life decay,	s
Lest the wise world should look into your moan	s
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,	s
O, lest the world should task you to recite	s
What merit lived in me, that you should love	s
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,	s
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;	s
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,	s
You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.	s
And hang more praise upon deceased I	s
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:	s
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,	s
That you for love speak well of me untrue,	s
My name be buried where my body is,	s
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.	s
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,	s
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.	s
That time of year thou mayst in me behold	s
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang	s
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	s
Doth follow night, who like a fiend	s
As after sunset fadeth in the west,	s
Which by and by black night doth take away,	s
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.	s
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire	s
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	s
As the death-bed whereon it must expire	s
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.	s
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,	s
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.	s
But be contented: when that fell arrest	s
Without all bail shall carry me away,	s
My life hath in this line some interest,	s
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.	s
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review	s
The very part was consecrate to thee:	s
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;	s
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:	s
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,	s
The prey of worms, my body being dead,	s
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,	s
The worth of that is that which it contains,	s
And that is this, and this with thee remains.	s
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;	s
And for the peace of you I hold such strife	s
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;	s
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon	s
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,	s
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;	s
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight	s
And by and by clean starved for a look;	s
Possessing or pursuing no delight,	s
Save what is had or must from you be took.	s
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,	s
Or gluttoning on all, or all away.	s
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,	s
So far from variation or quick change?	s
Why with the time do I not glance aside	s
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep	s
Why write I still all one, ever the same,	s
And keep invention in a noted weed,	s
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?	s
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,	s
And you and love are still my argument;	s
So all my best is dressing old words new,	s
Spending again what is already spent:	s
For as the sun is daily new and old,	s
So is my love still telling what is told.	s
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,	s
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;	s
In vowing new hate after new love bearing.	s
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.	s
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show	s
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;	s
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know	s
Time's thievish progress to eternity.	s
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,	s
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find	s
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,	s
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,	s
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse	s
And found such fair assistance in my verse	s
And under thee their poesy disperse.	s
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing	s
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly	s
Have added feathers to the learned's wing	s
And given grace a double majesty.	s
And by their verdict is determined	s
Whose influence is thine and born of thee:	s
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,	s
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;	s
But thou art all my art and dost advance	s
As high as learning my rude ignorance.	s
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,	s
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,	s
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd	s
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,	s
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument	s
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?	s
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent	s
He robs thee of and pays it thee again.	s
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word	s
From thy behavior; beauty doth he give	s
And found it in thy cheek; he can afford	s
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.	s
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,	s
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,	s
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,	s
To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!	s
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,	s
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.	s
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.	s
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.	s
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,	s
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;	s
Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,	s
He of tall building and of goodly pride:	s
Then if he thrive and I be cast away,	s
The worst was this; my love was my decay.	s
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,	s
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;	s
Although in me each part will be forgotten.	s
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:	s
The earth can yield me but a common grave,	s
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.	s
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,	s
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,	s
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse	s
When all the breathers of this world are dead;	s
You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--	s
Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;	s
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook	s
The dedicated words which writers use	s
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	s
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,	s
And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.	s
And therefore art enforced to seek anew	s
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days	s
And do so, love; yet when they have devised	s
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,	s
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized	s
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;	s
And their gross painting might be better used	s
Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.	s
And therefore to your fair no painting set;	s
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed	s
The barren tender of a poet's debt;	s
And therefore have I slept in your report,	s
That you yourself being extant well might show	s
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:	s
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.	s
This silence for my sin you did impute,	s
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;	s
For I impair not beauty being mute,	s
When others would give life and bring a tomb.	s
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes	s
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.	s
Who is it that says most? which can say more	s
Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?	s
In whose confine immured is the store	s
Which should example where your equal grew.	s
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell	s
That to his subject lends not some small glory;	s
But he that writes of you, if he can tell	s
That you are you, so dignifies his story,	s
Not making worse what nature made so clear,	s
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,	s
Making his style admired every where.	s
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,	s
Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.	s
While comments of your praise, richly compiled,	s
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,	s
To every hymn that able spirit affords	s
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.	s
And to the most of praise add something more;	s
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,	s
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.	s
Then others for the breath of words respect,	s
Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.	s
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,	s
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,	s
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?	s
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night	s
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.	s
That censures falsely what they see aright?	s
Which have no correspondence with true sight!	s
I was not sick of any fear from thence:	s
But when your countenance fill'd up his line,	s
Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.	s
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,	s
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:	s
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;	s
My bonds in thee are all determinate.	s
My soul doth tell my body that he may	s
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought	s
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,	s
And so my patent back again is swerving.	s
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,	s
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,	s
Comes home again, on better judgment making.	s
Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,	s
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.	s
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,	s
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,	s
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,	s
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.	s
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,	s
Upon thy part I can set down a story	s
Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,	s
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:	s
And I by this will be a gainer too;	s
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;	s
The injuries that to myself I do,	s
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.	s
Such is my love, to thee I so belong,	s
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.	s
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,	s
And I will comment upon that offence;	s
That follow'd it as gentle day	s
Against thy reasons making no defence.	s
My reason, the physician to my love,	s
To set a form upon desired change,	s
As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,	s
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,	s
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue	s
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,	s
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong	s
That every word doth almost tell my name,	s
For thee against myself I'll vow debate,	s
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.	s
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;	s
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,	s
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,	s
This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,	s
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,	s
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;	s
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,	s
To linger out a purposed overthrow.	s
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,	s
When other petty griefs have done their spite	s
But in the onset come; so shall I taste	s
At first the very worst of fortune's might,	s
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,	s
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,	s
Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,	s
Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,	s
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;	s
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,	s
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:	s
But these particulars are not my measure;	s
All these I better in one general best.	s
But when she saw my woeful state,	s
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,	s
Of more delight than hawks or horses be;	s
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:	s
Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take	s
But being both from me, both to each friend,	s
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,	s
For term of life thou art assured mine,	s
And life no longer than thy love will stay,	s
For it depends upon that love of thine.	s
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,	s
When in the least of them my life hath end.	s
I see a better state to me belongs	s
Than that which on thy humour doth depend;	s
Suspect I may, but not directly tell;	s
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.	s
O, what a happy title do I find,	s
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!	s
But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?	s
Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.	s
Like a deceived husband; so love's face	s
May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;	s
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:	s
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,	s
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.	s
In many's looks the false heart's history	s
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,	s
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.	s
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;	s
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,	s
How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,	s
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!	s
They that have power to hurt and will do none,	s
That do not do the thing they most do show,	s
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,	s
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,	s
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces	s
And husband nature's riches from expense;	s
They are the lords and owners of their faces,	s
Others but stewards of their excellence.	s
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,	s
Though to itself it only live and die,	s
But if that flower with base infection meet,	s
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:	s
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;	s
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.	s
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame	s
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,	s
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!	s
O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!	s
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,	s
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,	s
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;	s
When I perceive that men as plants increase,	s
O, what a mansion have those vices got	s
Which for their habitation chose out thee,	s
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,	s
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove	s
Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;	s
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.	s
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;	s
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:	s
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;	s
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,	s
As on the finger of a throned queen	s
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,	s
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,	s
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,	s
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!	s
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,	s
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!	s
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s
How like a winter hath my absence been	s
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!	s
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!	s
What old December's bareness every where!	s
And yet this time removed was summer's time,	s
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,	s
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,	s
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:	s
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me	s
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;	s
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,	s
And, thou away, the very birds are mute;	s
Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer	s
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.	s
From you have I been absent in the spring,	s
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made	s
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,	s
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.	s
Of different flowers in odour and in hue	s
Could make me any summer's story tell,	s
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;	s
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,	s
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;	s
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.	s
Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,	s
As with your shadow I with these did play:	s
The forward violet thus did I chide:	s
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,	s
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride	s
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells	s
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.	s
The lily I condemned for thy hand,	s
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:	s
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,	s
One blushing shame, another white despair;	s
Straight in her heart did mercy come,	s
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;	s
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth	s
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.	s
Holds in perfection but a little moment,	s
But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.	s
Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long	s
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?	s
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,	s
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?	s
Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem	s
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;	s
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem	s
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.	s
If thy unworthiness raised love in me,	s
If any, be a satire to decay,	s
And make Time's spoils despised every where.	s
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;	s
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.	s
O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends	s
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?	s
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;	s
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.	s
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,	s
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;	s
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;	s
But best is best, if never intermix'd?'	s
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?	s
Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee	s
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,	s
And to be praised of ages yet to be.	s
Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how	s
To make him seem long hence as he shows now.	s
My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;	s
I love not less, though less the show appear:	s
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming	s
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.	s
When I was wont to greet it with my lays,	s
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing	s
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,	s
Not that the summer is less pleasant now	s
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,	s
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,	s
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.	s
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,	s
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand	s
Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,	s
That having such a scope to show her pride,	s
The argument all bare is of more worth	s
O, blame me not, if I no more can write!	s
Look in your glass, and there appears a face	s
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,	s
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.	s
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,	s
To mar the subject that before was well?	s
For to no other pass my verses tend	s
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;	s
Was used in giving gentle doom,	s
Your own glass shows you when you look in it.	s
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,	s
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,	s
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold	s
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,	s
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd	s
In process of the seasons have I seen,	s
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,	s
Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,	s
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;	s
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,	s
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:	s
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;	s
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.	s
Let not my love be call'd idolatry,	s
Nor my beloved as an idol show,	s
Since all alike my songs and praises be	s
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.	s
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,	s
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;	s
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,	s
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.	s
'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,	s
To win me soon to hell, my female evil	s
And in this change is my invention spent,	s
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.	s
'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,	s
For that which longer nurseth the disease,	s
When in the chronicle of wasted time	s
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,	s
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme	s
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,	s
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,	s
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,	s
I see their antique pen would have express'd	s
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall.	s
So all their praises are but prophecies	s
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;	s
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,	s
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:	s
For we, which now behold these present days,	s
Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.	s
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul	s
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.	s
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured	s
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;	s
Incertainties now crown themselves assured	s
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.	s
But do not so; I love thee in such sort	s
My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,	s
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:	s
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,	s
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.	s
What's in the brain that ink may character	s
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?	s
What's new to speak, what new to register,	s
That may express my love or thy dear merit?	s
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,	s
I must, each day say o'er the very same,	s
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.	s
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.	s
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?	s
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,	s
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,	s
But makes antiquity for aye his page,	s
Finding the first conceit of love there bred	s
Where time and outward form would show it dead.	s
O, never say that I was false of heart,	s
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.	s
As easy might I from myself depart	s
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:	s
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,	s
Like him that travels I return again,	s
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,	s
So that myself bring water for my stain.	s
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd	s
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,	s
O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,	s
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;	s
For nothing this wide universe I call,	s
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.	s
Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there	s
And made myself a motley to the view,	s
Made old offences of affections new;	s
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth	s
Askance and strangely: but, by all above,	s
These blenches gave my heart another youth,	s
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.	s
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:	s
Mine appetite I never more will grind	s
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,	s
A god in love, to whom I am confined.	s
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,	s
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.	s
O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,	s
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,	s
That did not better for my life provide	s
Than public means which public manners breeds.	s
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,	s
And almost thence my nature is subdued	s
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:	s
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;	s
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink	s
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,	s
No bitterness that I will bitter think,	s
Nor double penance, to correct correction.	s
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye	s
Even that your pity is enough to cure me.	s
To swear against the truth so foul a lie!	s
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;	s
For what care I who calls me well or ill,	s
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?	s
You are my all the world, and I must strive	s
To know my shames and praises from your tongue:	s
None else to me, nor I to none alive,	s
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.	s
In so profound abysm I throw all care	s
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense	s
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.	s
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:	s
You are so strongly in my purpose bred	s
That all the world besides methinks are dead.	s
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;	s
And that which governs me to go about	s
Doth part his function and is partly blind,	s
Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.	s
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;	s
Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:	s
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more	s
From heaven to hell is flown away;	s
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,	s
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,	s
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?	s
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;	s
Incapable of more, replete with you,	s
My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.	s
Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,	s
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?	s
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?	s
And that your love taught it this alchemy,	s
To make of monsters and things indigest	s
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,	s
Creating every bad a perfect best,	s
No want of conscience hold it that I call	s
O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,	s
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:	s
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,	s
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:	s
If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin	s
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.	s
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,	s
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:	s
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why	s
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.	s
But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents	s
Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,	s
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,	s
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve	s
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,	s
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'	s
When I was certain o'er incertainty,	s
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?	s
Love is a babe; then might I not say so,	s
To give full growth to that which still doth grow?	s
Let me not to the marriage of true minds	s
Admit impediments. Love is not love	s
Which alters when it alteration finds,	s
Or bends with the remover to remove:	s
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark	s
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;	s
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks	s
Within his bending sickle's compass come:	s
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,	s
If this be error and upon me proved,	s
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.	s
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all	s
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	s
Tempteth my better angel from my side,	s
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;	s
And given to time your own dear-purchased right	s
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds	s
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.	s
Book both my wilfulness and errors down	s
And on just proof surmise accumulate;	s
Bring me within the level of your frown,	s
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;	s
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove	s
The constancy and virtue of your love.	s
Like as, to make our appetites more keen,	s
With eager compounds we our palate urge,	s
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,	s
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,	s
Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,	s
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding	s
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness	s
To be diseased ere that there was true needing.	s
Thus policy in love, to anticipate	s
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured	s
And brought to medicine a healthful state	s
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:	s
Now counting best to be with you alone,	s
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.	s
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,	s
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,	s
Still losing when I saw myself to win!	s
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,	s
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!	s
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	s
In the distraction of this madding fever!	s
O benefit of ill! now I find true	s
That better is by evil still made better;	s
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;	s
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.	s
So I return rebuked to my content	s
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.	s
That you were once unkind befriends me now,	s
And for that sorrow which I then did feel	s
Needs must I under my transgression bow,	s
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.	s
For if you were by my unkindness shaken	s
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,	s
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken	s
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd	s
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,	s
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd	s
And each, though enemies to either's reign,	s
But that your trespass now becomes a fee;	s
Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.	s
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,	s
When not to be receives reproach of being,	s
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd	s
Thyself away art resent still with me;	s
For why should others false adulterate eyes	s
Give salutation to my sportive blood?	s
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,	s
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?	s
No, I am that I am, and they that level	s
At my abuses reckon up their own:	s
I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;	s
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;	s
Unless this general evil they maintain,	s
All men are bad, and in their badness reign.	s
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain	s
Full character'd with lasting memory,	s
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love	s
Beyond all date, even to eternity;	s
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart	s
Have faculty by nature to subsist;	s
That in the very refuse of thy deeds	s
Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.	s
That poor retention could not so much hold,	s
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;	s
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,	s
To trust those tables that receive thee more:	s
To keep an adjunct to remember thee	s
Were to import forgetfulness in me.	s
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:	s
Thy pyramids built up with newer might	s
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;	s
They are but dressings of a former sight.	s
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire	s
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write	s
And rather make them born to our desire	s
Than think that we before have heard them told.	s
Thy registers and thee I both defy,	s
Not wondering at the present nor the past,	s
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might	s
Made more or less by thy continual haste.	s
This I do vow and this shall ever be;	s
I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.	s
If my dear love were but the child of state,	s
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'	s
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,	s
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.	s
No, it was builded far from accident;	s
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls	s
Under the blow of thralled discontent,	s
Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:	s
It fears not policy, that heretic,	s
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,	s
But all alone stands hugely politic,	s
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.	s
To this I witness call the fools of time,	s
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.	s
Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,	s
With my extern the outward honouring,	s
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	s
Which prove more short than waste or ruining?	s
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour	s
Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,	s
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,	s
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?	s
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,	s
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,	s
Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,	s
But mutual render, only me for thee.	s
Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul	s
When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.	s
Now with the drops of this most balmy time	s
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;	s
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st	s
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;	s
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,	s
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,	s
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill	s
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.	s
Love is too young to know what conscience is;	s
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:	s
Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,	s
And her quietus is to render thee.	s
In the old age black was not counted fair,	s
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;	s
But now is black beauty's successive heir,	s
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:	s
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,	s
Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,	s
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,	s
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.	s
Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,	s
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem	s
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,	s
Slandering creation with a false esteem:	s
Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,	s
How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,	s
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds	s
What merit do I in myself respect,	s
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,	s
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap	s
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,	s
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,	s
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,	s
To be so tickled, they would change their state	s
And situation with those dancing chips,	s
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,	s
Making dead wood more blest than living lips.	s
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,	s
Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.	s
At random from the truth vainly express'd;	s
Is lust in action; and till action, lust	s
Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,	s
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,	s
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,	s
Past reason hunted, and no sooner had	s
Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait	s
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;	s
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;	s
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;	s
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;	s
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.	s
All this the world well knows; yet none knows well	s
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.	s
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.	s
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;	s
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;	s
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,	s
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,	s
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;	s
And in some perfumes is there more delight	s
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.	s
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know	s
I grant I never saw a goddess go;	s
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:	s
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare	s
As any she belied with false compare.	s
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,	s
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;	s
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart	s
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.	s
The little Love-god lying once asleep	s
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:	s
To say they err I dare not be so bold,	s
Although I swear it to myself alone.	s
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,	s
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,	s
One on another's neck, do witness bear	s
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.	s
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,	s
And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.	s
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,	s
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,	s
Have put on black and loving mourners be,	s
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.	s
And truly not the morning sun of heaven	s
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,	s
Nor that full star that ushers in the even	s
Doth half that glory to the sober west,	s
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:	s
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart	s
Growing a bath and healthful remedy	s
And suit thy pity like in every part.	s
Then will I swear beauty herself is black	s
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.	s
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan	s
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!	s
If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.	s
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?	s
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:	s
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;	s
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.	s
For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye,	s
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;	s
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;	s
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:	s
And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,	s
What means the world to say it is not so?	s
So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,	s
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,	s
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine	s
Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:	s
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,	s
For thou art covetous and he is kind;	s
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me	s
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.	s
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,	s
Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,	s
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.	s
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.	s
Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:	s
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.	s
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'	s
To thee I send this written embassage,	s
More than enough am I that vex thee still,	s
To thy sweet will making addition thus.	s
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,	s
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?	s
Shall will in others seem right gracious,	s
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?	s
The sea all water, yet receives rain still	s
And in abundance addeth to his store;	s
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'	s
One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.	s
Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;	s
Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'	s
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,	s
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'	s
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,	s
Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.	s
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,	s
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.	s
In things of great receipt with ease we prove	s
Among a number one is reckon'd none:	s
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:	s
Though in thy stores' account I one must be;	s
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold	s
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:	s
And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'	s
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,	s
That they behold, and see not what they see?	s
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,	s
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.	s
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks	s
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,	s
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,	s
From hence your memory death cannot take,	s
Why should my heart think that a several plot	s
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?	s
Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,	s
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?	s
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,	s
And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.	s
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.	s
I do believe her, though I know she lies,	s
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,	s
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.	s
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	s
Although she knows my days are past the best,	s
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:	s
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.	s
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,	s
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,	s
And age in love loves not to have years told:	s
Therefore I lie with her and she with me,	s
And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.	s
O, call not me to justify the wrong	s
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;	s
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;	s
Use power with power and slay me not by art.	s
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,	s
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:	s
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might	s
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?	s
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows	s
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,	s
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,	s
Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,	s
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.	s
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press	s
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;	s
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express	s
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.	s
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,	s
Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;	s
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,	s
No news but health from their physicians know;	s
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,	s
And in my madness might speak ill of thee:	s
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	s
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,	s
That I may not be so, nor thou belied,	s
Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.	s
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,	s
For they in thee a thousand errors note;	s
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,	s
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;	s
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,	s
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,	s
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited	s
To any sensual feast with thee alone:	s
But my five wits nor my five senses can	s
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,	s
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,	s
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:	s
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,	s
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.	s
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,	s
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:	s
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,	s
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;	s
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,	s
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments	s
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;	s
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.	s
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those	s
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:	s
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows	s
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.	s
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,	s
By self-example mayst thou be denied!	s
Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch	s
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,	s
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?	s
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,	s
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,	s
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent	s
To follow that which flies before her face,	s
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;	s
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,	s
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,	s
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,	s
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:	s
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'	s
