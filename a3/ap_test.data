Will give me to a darker doom ; 	b
Through a sky of cloudy grey. 	b
Reflects that winter sky : 	b
In glimpses of a spirit shore 	b
A silent, silvery star. 	b
And I have long forgot to weep. 	b
Sweetly has its dawn begun ; 	b
But the heaven may shake with thunder 	b
Himself restored to infancy? 	b
To leave my lonely halls ! ' 	b
Bless thee, bless all I cannot speak ; 	b
For the moon now beaming mild above 	b
Go, shed thy tears in Ocean's wave 	b
From that wide heaven where every star 	b
IF grief for grief can touch thee, 	b
One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings 	b
Within their perfumed bower, 	b
Of sorrows gathering near, 	b
From her stately form and her features rare, 	b
And young leaves shoot among the fern. 	b
The twilight fading from the skies, 	b
What ! shall they carve on his tomb with the sword 	b
How thou didst turn in mockery 	b
Sparkling in sunshine and in dew, 	b
Had its waters worn the shore. 	b
Methinks the mellowing haze of years 	b
No doubt had marr'd my word ; 	b
TELL me, tell me, smiling child, 	b
What the past is like to thee? 	b
As glancing o'er the moorland track, 	b
Something in that ancestral pride 	b
Tell me what is the present hour? 	b
A green and flowery spray, 	b
Where a young bird sits gathering its power 	b
Your cold hands hardly hold the weary pen : 	b
And what is the future, happy one? 	b
Sunk to peace the twilight breeze : 	b
A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea, 	b
Stretching into infinity. 	b
The inspiring music's thrilling sound, 	b
No, Earth would wish no other sphere 	b
The glittering splendour rising round, 	b
Yet of the native shepherds none, 	b
So stilly round the evening falls ; 	b
To keep my honour fair ; 	b
Covering her brow to hide the tear 	b
The shepherd placed a seat and pressed 	b
From it the torrents flow ? 	b
Never put back that golden flow 	b
That murmur to the breezes' call 	b
The laden bee flew home, 	b
And raised the covering from his brow, 	b
* Nay, call me not ; it may not be ; 	b
Still spoke to me of years gone by ; 	b
Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending ; 	b
Man's spirit away from the drear dungeon sending, 	b
And sound and sight had well combined 	b
All down the mountain-sides wild forests lending 	b
The mighty voice to the life-giving wind ; 	b
With dying torments riven 	b
Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending, 	b
The withering corpse to me. 	b
The busy day has glided by, 	b
For not through age, and not through crime, 	b
Of the golden-gifted time ; 	b
And, Douglas ! thou shalt be 	b
When my sad soul forgot its pride 	b
Since cast from off thine angel brow 	b
Woods, you need not frown on me ; 	b
I have suffered on thro' night and day ; 	b
To know where she is laid. 	b
You need not mock so bitterly. 	b
Thy silvery form, so soft and fair, 	b
I watched how evening took the place 	b
And, far away, down Elmor scars 	b
* The birds that now so blithely sing, 	b
And warms the breezy air. 	b
The waste of youth, the waste of years, 	b
COME walk with me, 	b
And still the words and still the tone 	b
I dream of moor, and misty hill, 	b
In all the hours of gloom 	b
Will find a heart to bear. 	b
WELL narrower draw the circle round, 	b
Laid low in dust their Dryad-hair. 	b
Through the long nights of angry weather, 	b
When parted ghosts might come, 	b
Above their prisoned dust to grieve 	b
Its twilight hours and evenings dark 	b
Whose waves are foaming far and wide. 	b
One gush of ardent prayer. 	b
Forget the hopes of years : 	b
With the radiant red of furnace flames 	b
Senselessly has lain. 	b
To the discord of lute-strings all unstrung. 	b
My robes, and smooth my tangled hair ; 	b
And constant sorrow on my brow 	b
The saints shall shelter thee from harm. 	b
And spread with smiles the evening meal ; 	b
In years by time long left behind ; 	b
TO A WREATH OF SNOW 	b
When I began to pray. 	b
And still it bent above, 	b
They come sailing on, 	b
How oft have I forgot my God, 	b
Yet my heart loves December's smile 	b
That tracks the boundless blue. 	b
Paints her image on the mind. 	b
Of gazing in thine eyes. 	b
And think the fearful vision o'er. 	b
The blossoms to deck my home with the dead. 	b
Tis like the heaven which parting days 	b
The idol chiefs of all. 	b
As if grown weary of the light 	b
When its lips opened and a sound 	b
Awoke the stillness reigning round, 	b
Faint as a dream, but the earth shrank, 	b
And truly like a god she seems, 	b
Woe for the day ! Regina's pride, 	b
Retracing back her lifetime flown ; 	b
And thus in strange response he spoke. 	b
The circling hills to kiss. 	b
Where fairer forms in darkness lie ; 	b
That time is treasuring up for me. 	b
Sound through the granite glen ; 	b
All vague and undefined ? 	b
That sad lament was ringing ; 	b
Twill break for thee. 	b
Such dreamy, dreary singing. 	b
Aware her last hour approaching fast, 	b
Of mirror broken on the grass, 	b
Watch for a bird with sable wing, 	b
And weaker minds would fear. 	b
I listened to thy mournful sighing. 	b
Were by a faint breeze blown ; 	b
I knew the source whence sprung those tears 	b
They raise their eyes, for the sunny skies 	b
Reveal ; where o'er a lone green wood 	b
How well my spirit knows the path 	b
Was given me in that silent hour 	b
In a yeoman's home-close grew ; 	b
In cell and cloister drear ; 	b
At last the sunshine left the ground, 	b
The bright blue flowers and velvet sod, 	b
Were strange conductors to the bowers 	b
I need not fear my foes, 	b
Aid for that which lies before. 	b
In a grave that never shuts its dead 	b
Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface 	b
In cloudy morning clothed the sky. 	b
Come, sit down on this sunny stone ; 	b
I saw His wisdom infinite, 	b
In her uncovered eye ; 	b
But beneath the earth is midnight 	b
Waiting to hear the lingering feet 	b
And whistles round the gloomy wall, 	b
And lingering long, and thinking grieves, 	b
How it longed how it burned to be free ! 	b
And no one laughed, and none seemed free from 	b
He wakens, and how ghastly white 	b
By whom all things were made ; 	b
So, resting on a heathy bank, 	b
And will sustain when thou art gone. 	b
me mourn ; 	b
An anguish in his bosom now ; 	b
COMPANIONS all day long we 've stood 	b
Fixed strainedly on the vacant air ; 	b
His wisdom so divine, 	b
Weak, wretched sinner though I be, 	b
Sleeping silently and still, 	b
On Eversham's woody brow. 	b
That living, is not nobler now 	b
Too full to hide their tears, too stern to overflow ; 	b
To see the sunshine disappear ; 	b
The breeze sings like a summer breeze 	b
Then silent weep J cannot weep, 	b
Cut off from hope in early day, 	b
From earth and glory cut away. 	b
That haunts his feudal home ; 	b
Must image forth the scowl of night, 	b
And childhood's flower must waste its bloom 	b
Beneath the shadow of the tomb. 	b
Though vengeance held a sheathed sword 	b
And still did evening fall ; 	b
Through infinite immensity. 	b
Wave gently round her head. 	b
Tells what once those features were, 	b
By that celestial shine I 	b
And the dying their last watch were keeping 	b
Let us be laid in lasting rest, 	b
Lost their robes of tender green ? 	b
That I should greet approaching feet, 	b
Half the sweet, the haunting smile ; 	b
Other desires and other hopes beset me, 	b
There is a voice in the wind that waves 	b
And pleasure tune its chords again. 	b
And my eyes cannot hold the tears 	b
Was it some feeling of delight, 	b
From the time of morning's earliest dew 	b
Blasts with that oath his perjured soul, 	b
Kindle a short and bitter smile, 	b
The sun of evening died, 	b
Sleep, stilly sleep, thou bright-haired child, 	b
Its large dark eyes of shadowy light, 	b
Waveless and calm lies that silent deep 	b
They fleck with shade our mountains bright 	b
A little longer in this reverie : 	b
Upon its heathy shores. 	b
But not a dream of sleep ; 	b
Ah ! could my hand unlock its chain, 	b
Were off like light again. 	b
For every torturing tear. 	b
And chained was every tongue. 	b
To mourn o'er what I mourn. 	b
God ! bless her sun with victory, 	b
In some warm nook a couch to find. 	b
strong and far : 	b
Fluttering from the autumn tree. 	b
That through the shadows shone 	b
The languid lid would close, 	b
Though I no more may watchful bend 	b
Through dreams where startling imagery 	b
Can no memory now recall 	b
Home to their journey's end ; 	b
ALONE I sat ; the summer day 	b
Had died in smiling light away ; 	b
Returning to my breast again. 	b
For past misery are we weeping? 	b
I will sail the desert sea. 	b
Roams in the dawn of day ; 	b
The harvest-moon looks down ; 	b
Look on those woods, look on that mountain lorn, 	b
I '11 hide it in my heart no more, 	b
Then why is all so sad and lone? 	b
How invincible its roar, 	b
A shattered wreck on ocean's tide, 	b
But that at Ambition's bidding, 	b
The heart so long endeared to thee, 	b
Are you a hawk to follow the prey, 	b
Till death shall sound his signal cry, 	b
Visions by ardent fancy fed 	b
And yet a dreamlike comfort came 	b
But now, when I had hoped to sing, 	b
My fingers strike a tuneless string ; 	b
Who bound us in one vigorous whole 	b
Still clung she to his bridle rein 	b
Yet have I read these falcon eyes, 	b
He faintly prayed, < O Death, delay 	b
But a tyrant spell has bound me, 	b
'Tis like old age pretending 	b
Roofless, crumbling to the ground ; 	b
Their bare boughs weighed with snow, 	b
We both together struck the blow ; 	b
And yet I cannot go. 	b
OH, all the cares these noontide airs 	b
Wastes beyond wastes below ; 	b
When the sun first crowned the hill, 	b
Beneath these sullen skies? 	b
I 'LL come when thou art saddest, 	b
Bring light to the darkened room, 	b
When the rude day's mirth has vanished, 	b
Spirit of bliss ! what brings thee here, 	b
Long he gazed and held his breath, 	b
I '11 come when the heart's worst feeling 	b
Has entire, unbiassed sway, 	b
But some I read so well, 	b
And gives to fancy magic power 	b
It was a summer day that saw 	b
Listen ! 'tis just the hour, 	b
But who reads not through the tender glow 	b
But thank your passion not for me ! 	b
A flood of strange sensations roll, 	b
Forerunners of a sterner power, 	b
Heralds of me? 	b
THE soft unclouded blue of air, 	b
Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke 	b
How daredst thou wake thoughts in me, 	b
And lived upon this weary Earth 	b
But then I knew that he stood free, 	b
Was it the smile of early spring 	b
And then I felt . . . \unfinished\. 	b
Now trust a heart that trusts in you, 	b
Douglas leaned above the well ; 	b
And may not be forgiven. 	b
My heart is with your heart at home ; 	b
cold, cold is my heart ! 	b
We both were scorned, both sternly driven 	b
Over his own unhappy soul ; 	b
Unless I change in every thought, 	b
And memory will restore me nought, 	b
Look now she rests below, 	b
The clouds are earthward yearning ; 	b
The smothering snow-clouds rolled away ; 	b
The barren mountain-side lies bare, 	b
He would not give one moorland wild 	b
As shines earth's sun in summer noon 	b
And whiter brows than yours may be, 	b
Where city walls spread wide around 	b
And lightning looks from orbs divine 	b
About my pathway burn and shine. 	b
But that pure light, changeless and strong, 	b
That last dim beam that sets for thee, 	b
Echoing to their bells. 	b
My feeble faith still clings to Thee. 	b
When we were wont to burst away 	b
Remembrance never dies, 	b
From hope, and peace, and power, and 	b
Her former life's eventful day 	b
Know nought akin to our despair ; 	b
Without a voice to speak to you 	b
For that mist may break when the sun is high, 	b
For bygone griefs and dried-up tears. 	b
In open day and cheerful sun, 	b
Lord Lesley, let it free ; 	b
Waiting the death that was to come. 	b
On which it ought to wend. 	b
Sleep brings no strength to me, 	b
Must claim from Justice lasting rest ; 	b
Youth's warm affections gave, 	b
To meet its early tomb ? 	b
Mad though that anguish be, 	b
As warm as middle June. 	b
And yet it seems a dreary moor, 	b
Was heavier far than earth can be ; 	b
A shelter from the sky. 	b
And never Fejian devotee 	b
My only wish is to forget 	b
In endless sleep of death. 	b
Fireless hearths, and lifeless homes ; 	b
Had they but seen their idol then, 	b
Strong I stand, and laugh to see 	b
That leaf from its parent tree ; 	b
Shut out from joy and liberty, 	b
All the puny ways of men ; 	b
The first to fight, the last to fall, 	b
Then come again ; thou wilt not shrink 	b
The glory of the festal day, 	b
Ought for a moment to be mine : 	b
Affrightened from that ceaseless roar. 	b
Beneath its mighty glare : 	b
Thing of Dust, with boundless pride, 	b
Dare you ask me for a guide ? 	b
Will hardly let her gleam, 	b
Or any, but an exile's doom. 	b
Windows through whose broken panes the night- 	b
To free the world from tyrant's chain, 	b
For which we fought and bled and died. 	b
I saw her give th' unanswered kiss 	b
Full soon divided him from me. 	b
Where their bright glories shone at first. 	b
To shelter 'neath a foreign heaven ; 	b
Till far beyond earth's frenzied strife, 	b
That should startle the nations that rest around. 	b
What pleasant airs upon her face 	b
Confused and strange and drear. 	b
She sits and fondly seems to trace 	b
And never more at early dawning 	b
And I must see the final gloom 	b
The accursed man shall be ; 	b
Dear childhood's innocence forgive, 	b
And my eye can wander through worlds of light. 	b
Methinks their chime sounds faint and drear, 	b
My lids closed down, yet through their veil 	b
The glory of a summer sky. 	b
And form my mood to Nature's mood. 	b
The tiny ripples flame. 	b
Went, and ne'er returned again ! 	b
I cannot bear to go away. 	b
May beam the blaze of July's sun, 	b
To soothe your grief or calm your care ; 	b
Nay, do not weep ; that bitter mourning 	b
And man's remarks or sighs or scorn, 	b
Full many a heart, that in the tomb, 	b
For ever dark, for ever cold. 	b
You '11 dry your tears and check your sighing, 	b
Lie low and lone the silent dead ; 	b
FALL, leaves, fall ; die, flowers, away ; 	b
If I were quite alone, 	b
One ripple in the lovely lake ; 	b
Lost, cursed, degraded all for thee ! 	b
There are bones whitening there in the 	b
Fernando left his home and you, 	b
And still I think you must remember 	b
Marking my despondency. 	b
Lit by the evening flame, 	b
I longed to see his face again, 	b
From his daylong dream at once he woke ; 	b
Better that I my own fate mourning, 	b
Except for you, my dearest queen ! 	b
There lies a lone and lovely glade, 	b
And there the hearts together nourished, 	b
Since parted from thee I am left alone, 	b
The afternoon in softened glory 	b
In the old church beneath the stone, 	b
And the broad park spread before me 	b
And curse instead of pray. 	b
And there I stood when he had left me, 	b
With ashy cheek and tearless eye, 	b
Watching the ship whose sail bereft me 	b
In gathering gloom in every glade, 	b
By the wild storm blasts roughly broke, 	b
O may I never lose the peace 	b
My soul still bounded o'er the billow, 	b
The curtains waved, the wakened flies 	b
The azure flowers where they were nursed, 	b
One brief glimpse to thine eye, I 	b
Its much-desired repose. 	b
Of safe deliverance from the sea. 	b
Yet, alas ! the sooner turning 	b
And drowned my bloom of youth in tears. 	b
And time at length brought power for coping 	b
With thoughts I could not once endure. 	b
MAY flowers are opening, 	b
The place that saw our last farewell, 	b
Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe, 	b
In plundered churches piled with dead 	b
Go out upon the breezy moor ; 	b
AWAKE, awake ! how loud the stormy morning 	b
Calls up to life the nation's resting round ; 	b
What follows in Ula's garden sweet 	b
And violet and wild woodrose 	b
One whisper, one sweet dream in him, 	b
' Twill only yield another sight 	b
That while the world was lost to her 	b
A beam of glory there, 	b
It was cultured by another hand, 	b
A traitor's perjury. 	b
And her look of Majesty. 	b
The sea-green standard lies in dust beneath. 	b
To which my own was given ; 	b
Soldiers, preserve that glory bright and free ; 	b
It was just the time of eve, 	b
Let me remember half the woes 	b
Are but the shattered glass 	b
Can still the spirit's storm ; 	b
While thou canst speak with such a tone ! 	b
But how can I live lonely here? 	b
From turret, tower and wall. 	b
And prone to every sin ; 	b
And in the haze of glorious light 	b
I have sat lonely all the day, 	b
In the pure light of childhood's morn, 	b
Where blackbird and the throstle dwell ; 	b
Save that deep gong which tolled my 	b
A thousand strains of Music swell. 	b
For God alone doth know how blessed 	b
And every listener swears it true ; 	b
And tell me, why such blessed sleep 	b
Unlike the bloom I like to see. 	b
So full of soul, so deeply sweet ; 	b
The grave must close those limbs around, 	b
The moonbeam and the storm, 	b
While the wind is whispering only, 	b
Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim. 	b
How can I break these iron chains, 	b
Are the hours to come, the joyless hours, 	b
With beams of such impartial blaze, 	b
It chained the snow-swollen streams no more. 	b
And they will reach it soon. 	b
And then a sudden flash of flame, 	b
And leave my human feelings 	b
Into my heart and anxious eye, 	b
Then his eyes began to weary, 	b
Amid the howling storm of war? 	b
care and tears and pain. 	b
But coldly breaks November's day ; 	b
But hate eternally. 1 	b
Eldenna's waves are rolling red, 	b
Shade of history, I condemn 	b
If my spirit's eye can see, 	b
And deeper green is on the hill. 	b
I looked out to see her there, 	b
They all are held in me ; 	b
And all seem glad their voice to hear ; 	b
Wisdom, scorned, knows no relenting ; 	b
A tear might flow, ay, many a tear, 	b
And there in those wild bowers 	b
No whisper, not to me ; 	b
I could not sleep through that wild siege, 	b
I know that I have done thee wrong, 	b
And mourned a love for ever flown. 	b
Sank back again to childhood's day ; 	b
Its cheering smile to see, 	b
That sin was purified by woe. 	b
Your worlds of solemn light, again, 	b
To us, in unimagined bloom, 	b
And she springs up in haste to greet 	b
And thou art near thy prime? 	b
It was a pleasant April day 	b
So I knew that he was dying 	b
Watching the drizzly mist descend, 	b
Descend like rain upon the heath. 	b
Its deadly mist o'er joys and cares. 	b
Held by the mountain men. 	b
Like bandit-knife was hung. 	b
And what shall change that angel brow, 	b
To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region ; 	b
Laid on the grass I lapsed away, 	b
Blend with a song of troubled times. 	b
To seize the falling rein. 	b
Thus thy first hour's course shall be : 	b
With voice subdued and steady look, 	b
Spring grass grows green and fair ; 	b
Call Death yes Death he is mine own, 	b
To live in every sweetest thought ; 	b
And sweeter than a flute's reply 	b
Where royal corpses lay. 	b
And there was eastern incense burnt, 	b
For sun, before they close, 	b
In mercy launch one arrow more ; 	b
With sacred halos round it shed ? 	b
But death has stolen our company, 	b
And words upon the breezes hung. 	b
Its sufferings and its tears. 	b
' Bless it ! My gracious God ! ' I cried. 	b
Welcome at last, though once so drear. 	b
Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish 	b
Shall our feet forget the way ? 	b
Vainly would man divine or tell. 	b
STRONG I stand, though I have borne 	b
Look how in sable gloom 	b
A darker wave. 	b
Glows o'er the graves of Elrington, 	b
It was about the middle night 	b
So their fond hearts were free, 	b
The shallow wrecks of memories 	b
Looks down on the descending sun ; 	b
Thou art my intimate delight, 	b
Deep secrets of His Providence 	b
It pines in cold captivity, 	b
One penance tender tears. 	b
HINDER me by no delay ! 	b
He dared not say me nay the hinges harshly turn. 	b
Yonder they stand and watch the waves 	b
What have I now? The star that brightly 	b
Dry thine eyes, too ; 'tis vain to keep 	b
HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES 	b
Now seems as nothing in the single cloud 	b
That laid my best affections low, 	b
That thou wouldst call to mind. 	b
And yet, a king, though Prudence well 	b
My horse had strayed, I cannot say ; 	b
Zamorna is this nobly done, 	b
But could the day seem dark to me 	b
Those tones were softer than the moan 	b
Has passed from summer's heaven divine, 	b
I ask for nothing further here 	b
From the side of the wintry brae. 	b
I should not be if that were gone 	b
YES, holy be thy resting-place 	b
THROUGH the hours of yesternight 	b
She murmured with a sigh. 	b
And nations round are fearing, 	b
So humbly by her side ; 	b
That set on fire my heart, but froze upon my 	b
An icy glory caught mine eye, 	b
O come away ! The Norman door 	b
And my glad heart bound wilder still. 	b
From his heart's fountain swell, 	b
My hour of rest had fleeted by, 	b
Toss up the window's velvet veil, 	b
What is past can hurt no more ; 	b
To sit within this Norman door, 	b
No : that I feel can never be ; 	b
* Angora's hills have heard their tread, 	b
* Well, thou hast fought for many a year, 	b
Like youth, to my maturer eyes, 	b
She sees us, sister, now ; 	b
And I have sat and watched the trees, 	b
Their glory-haloed crown to wear. 	b
And merry words to whispers die, 	b
Whose forms have troubled me, 	b
The woods and fields and golden flowers 	b
That we must bind thee down and clench thy 	b
Is welcome as a friend ; 	b
Though earth and man were gone, 	b
False and foolish mortal know, 	b
I 've trod a dark and frightful way. 	b
As kindly as the good. 	b
The pure blue heaven with clouds of gold ; 	b
Though not for fear, though not for shame. 	b
Which shapeless figures on each piece 	b
Those eyes shall make my only day, 	b
As long as thou, the solemn night, 	b
My outward sense is gone, my inward essence 	b
And the crags where I wandered of old. 	b
Joins the mad world in all its scorn. 	b
Bore his soul from earth away. 	b
Then why lament that those we love 	b
And wild birds bursting from their songless nest, 	b
But yet it was a glorious sun, 	b
When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes 	b
What my soul bore, my soul alone 	b
Have studied long their glance and feel 	b
And all my prospect of relief 	b
His heart is stirred through all its strings, 	b
And then a wakening from above ; 	b
As it tossed against the heaven, 	b
